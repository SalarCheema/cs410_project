"There's zero chance that this is going to make anyone change their mind about who we are talking about here. For one thing, Trump is absolutely fine and likely less than 24 hours away from saying something crazy that will immediately remind everyone what a narcissistic turdbucket he is.

"There is a simple explanation for the media bias against Democrats.  Many, if not most Democratic national politicians have stated that they intend to raise taxes on the wealthy.  Republican politicians universally promote tax cuts for their patrons, the wealthy. For the wealthy it is an easy choice.

The wealthy own or control virtually all corporate media.  They outright own the entire right wing propaganda machine and dominate ""mainstream media"" via stockholder pressure and/or advertising blackmail.  Accordingly, virtually all news reports reflect the wishes of the wealthy which is to make Dems look bad and to polish GOP crap.

I think the wealthy despise Trump at least as much as we do but because he represents tax breaks for them and the chaos that surrounds him advances the nation towards their ultimate goal of a plutocracy where the wealthy will not have to pay taxes, they will be able to pass their fortunes intact through the generations and it will be illegal for the treasury to give money to anyone who is not wealthy.",Democrats,comment,lib,41

He and my grandpa were friends and they held similar views. My sign has been up for a week or two. And while cutting the grass, he walked out of his house and started pointing at my sign, walking towards me. ""Here we go..."" I thought. But when I cut the motor, he asked ""Where did you get that?"" I told him I got it from the local Democrats Club.
Then he asked, “Do you think they'll give me one if I asked?"" | was taken aback and told him of course I would get him a sign. He thanked me and went back in his house. I was able to call my contacts and get him a sign that same day. Now with our signs, in just our neighborhood, there are

"The year was 2016 and I had just moved from North Dakota to Charleston, South Carolina. I had started a new job as a cook and one of the waiters wanted to take me out for a couple of drinks after work. He invited his wife and things were going great. You know how sometimes you meet someone and it just clicks? Like, the chemistry was awesome. Laughter, stories, beers and just an over all great night.
Then, Trump came up. The wife said that anyone who supported Trump was bad and yes, deplorable. Now, me, at the time, defended the Trump supporters and my input was that I knew some people that were Trumpers in North Dakota and they weren’t at all bad people. 
Things went to shit very very quickly. She was passionate about the fact that anyone who was conservative is a racist, mysoginistic bigot. And once again, I defended the trumpers back in North Dakota and by my defense it was as if I was coming across as a conservative and the attacks were then projected onto me.
At the time I was a Bernie bro. Which had put my physical safety into danger more than once in good ‘ol’ North Dakota. So, the hostility with the wife of the waiter was tame compared to what some people would threaten when I would defend Obama’s record in Dakota.
Anyway, I felt obligated to share this anecdote because even though there is noway I could contact that woman from 2016 now, I think it’s appropriate for me to say that I’m sorry and she was right. Everything that the republicans have done, said and plan to do is fucking vile and disgusting. At this point, anyone who supports the maga movement isn’t necessarily stupid, but there seems to be a missing human characteristic. And I thing that missing characteristic is empathy. I think with the lack of empathy makes a person fucking evil. 
I’m sorry wife of the waiter lady, you were right and that night went to shit because I didn’t have the intuition of the compounding effects of what a maga world would look like in taking away freedoms and safety to woman, people of color and people of different sexual orientations and religious beliefs. I was wrong in believing that the maga party would have at least one redeeming quality, which they do not.",Democrats,comment,lib,12

"i’ve come to the conclusion that MAGA supporters lack object permanence.

trump allows them to see a certain side of him via rallies and online presence. he tells his lies and claims he’s innocent then logs off, and they believe he ceases to exist in any other context outside of that.

I compare it to episodes in a TV series. it’s kind of implied that there is an amount of time that passes in between episodes. for example: episode 1 ends with the main character going to sleep. episode 2 begins with the main character and his/her friends walking into school for the day.

the audience kind of understands that just because they didnt film what happens from the time the main character wakes up and gets ready for school and the beginning of episode 2, that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

I don’t think trump supporters have the ability to do that. I don’t think they understand that they only see .03% of Trumps real day to day life and interactions, and they can’t fathom a concept of who he is outside of the version he allows them to see.

so they are like little babies without object permanence. or dogs. [derogatory]

He will let him do whatever they want and either say it’s not his problem what other people do OR he will secretly back it. Remember that Trump’s biggest crutch is his need to be liked and he surrounds himself with yes men. If the Project 2025 people kiss his ass and tell him he’s a great man, he’ll definitely work to keep those people happy. Especially when he’s got the likes of Elon Musk and other Republicans in his corner. Same with not having to vote after this election.

MAGA is afraid, and they should be. Not only is America ready for a woman in office, America needs a woman in office. If Kamala Harris wins, her legacy won't just be for being the first woman in the Oval Office, but also for healing a broken nation torn apart by the hateful actions of Trump.

I believe that she understands both her place and the place of Trump in this political performance - and while her face registered all of her thoughts as she stood there at times in disbelief, still she was not cruel.

"That is a huge issue on the right. Once they decide someone is a Democrat, they want to hear nothing they say.  So they never listen to speeches,  state of the unions or other things from the D's. That way, what they think and believe can not be challenged.

I have been a Democrat since Reagan after casting my first vote for Ford. I have not missed a single inauguration, State of the Union or convention regardless of party. This year I watched every televised minute of BOTH conventions..why?... Because I want to know.

My mother-in-law and father-in-law were 24/7 fox news watchers. He passed a couple of years ago, she moved in with me and her daughter , 82YO. She only knew what fox told her, never heard a speech from Obama until tonight, claimed she did not like Nancy, Obama, Biden and on and on. I asked why did you not like them, she had no answer. FOX told her they were bad people.

She watched both conventions with me and my wife, who are political and history nerds and we don't miss any of these things, left and right. There is a BRIGHT difference between Trump and Harris. And tonight after the 2nd Gentleman , Mr and Mrs Obama's speech I am 99% sure she is a Harris voter in Nov.

That is why the right is always pushing the fake news, liberal media  and lying Democrats  meme because if a slightly open-minded republican voter is exposed to the other side, they come to realize it is the right  that is lying and depending on   misinformation and propaganda to keep them in the camp.

2. The amount of people, also on the younger side, who are undecided and ""still doing my research""... Yet, when asked, they can't name a specific issue they care about, or a proposed policy, and, comically, didn't watch the Harris-Trump debate. Good researching 🙄

I remember canvassing for our independence referendum. Govt had published a 140+ page white paper on what it would mean, how it would happen etc. 

Fair enough there were some omissions and those against argued it made some claims that weren’t supported (tho I disagree of course). 

But the bit that frustrated me most is you knocked on a door and you’d be talking to an undecided voter that would just dribble “we’re not being told enough information”…like this isn’t even just an election it’s the future of the country here and you can’t even be bothered to go online and read the report made especially for you, the one that’s linked to on every leaflet and post and we even distributed paper copies.

"Hi. Pseudo young person and passionate volunteer and voter here. I see this rhetoric a lot that young voters are apathetic and I do agree with this sentiment but instead of putting the blame 100% on younger eligible voters, I also place a lot of the blame on the society that puts emphasis on the importance of voting but does almost nothing in our educational institutions to teach what political positions actually do.

I am the vice chair of my voting precinct and we found that voters are more likely to show up to the polls if they are given the information necessary to understand what the position they are voting for can ACTUALLY influence. We have so many politicians these days running ads or trying to draw voters by placing highlights on issues they really have no control over. Sure it’s important to know that a Democratic candidate is pro-life or pro-choice but it seems more likely that someone isn’t going to fill in the bubble for county commissioners if they do not understand why that position is important and what they do. So we run our canvassing to help people answer the questions they might have about the down ballot offices to see if there is an issue they consider important that that person could influence.

In short, I would encourage folks to shy away from exclusively beating the drum of “young people do not care” as I find that is only a percentage of the issue. Our government systems are complex and, especially in this day and age, a young person working 3 jobs to stay alive doesn’t always have time to put energy into doing ALL THEIR OWN self education about government leaders.",Democrats,comment,lib,65

My wife was of the mind that she didn't feel her vote actually counted until I explained the process to her.

"It's always been like this unfortunately. I mean half the country doesn't vote in general so it's all generations that play a part in this. But there is definitely alot of young people who are just apolitical and have no interest in voting or basic level politics at all, or are very apathetic and disenfranchised with the US government so they don't vote.

My outlook on it, is that you're not going to get every single person you meet in volunteering to get interested in voting. It's just not feasible or realistic at all, however if you meet with 20 Young people for example and if you just get 7 or 8 of them registered or interested to vote, that's good work and something to be proud about.

Look at it like baseball with getting younger people interested in voting. Going 2-5 or 3-5 at the plate isn't a bad day at all. Getting 2 out of every 5 people you talk to interested is not bad at all, and it adds up over time.",Democrats,comment,lib,163

Then if I try to point out that Trump and Bibi will turn Palestine into glass and the personal freedoms that they take for granted might vaporize, they shrug.

"Bush's legacy is at risk. By staying out of politics since leaving office he has managed to increase his popularity from the worst president in history to the middle of the pack.

It's a pity since objectively he was one of the worst presidents in history. On his watch:

1. Utterly failed and incompetent response to hurricane Katrina

2. The extraordinary economic crisis of 2008 - that was directly the result of the GOP policy he strongly favored of deregulating Wall Street. Millions of families lost their home and their savings due to this avoidable crisis.

3. Massive intelligence failures that lead to 911 (I don't actually blame him for this - but it was on his watch).

4. Starting 2 indefensible and unwinnable wars that lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.  Iraq - which technically you can argue we ""won"" - but the end result was the deaths of some 600,000 civilians and corrupt and unstable regime - not to mention destabilizing the mid-east.  Afghanistan - the longest war in US history that we retreated from in chaos after Trump drew down our forces to an unsustainable level that lead to Biden to pull out the remaining instead of re-enforcing the troops and attempting to restart the war in search of a better ending.  

But Bush is a nice guy and so long as he doesn't piss anyone off his reputation keeps getting better.",Democrats,comment,lib,13

Thoughts on Mark Kelly for Kamala Harris' VP pick?,Democrats,post,lib,6377
"I live in AZ.

Right now AZ is a toss up.

Kelly will deliver and down ballot races- there are congressional seats that will flip D with him.

I think its the best choice.",Democrats,comment,lib,1546
"As people, politicians, and Dems, I like all the choices.

As, specifically, VP to backup Kamala Harris, I like Mark Kelly the most.

He's probably got more name recognition nationally than ppl like Shapiro, Walz, and Beshear. His being married to Gabby Giffords helps neutralize the bump Trump might have gained from the failed assassination. Former Navy pilot who flew combat missions in the Gulf War. Fucking astronaut.

As a fellow bald man, I like that he's reppin for us r/bald folks.",Democrats,comment,lib,385
"Mark Kelly is the obvious pick, and Harris should just pull the trigger.

Blah, blah, blah, 11 year old girls should be forced to carry rape babies to term...

Kelly:

I have been to space you cherub nazi sycophant",Democrats,comment,lib,831
"Kelly, Beshear, Waltz in that order. I'm from PA, I'd like to keep Shapiro.",Democrats,comment,lib,432
"Astronauts are mostly considered American heroes by everyone, no matter the party.  Kelly makes political sense.  I'd love Pete as VP, but idk if everyone's ready for him.  Make him secretary of state or defense, though?  He'll be ready for the big chair in '32.",Democrats,comment,lib,181
"Best pick for victory. He has the best story, a good bipartisan record, a decent speaker, a good contrast with Vance. Vance is a military veteran and has rags to riches story. Kelly was the son of 2 police officers, and a military veteran who flew multiple missions in Desert storm. (Mother was one of the first women police in his town.) Kelly also is supported by McCain Republicans, so he already has appeal with moderate Republicans. He won with a collation made up of the same voters Biden did. Picking him could boost turnout in Arizona if not popularity. Helping Gallego as well as Harris. Kelly is good on immigration, which is Harris’s weakest issue. And Kelly is so good at immigration a MAGA Mayor said he would have trouble voting for Trump if Kelly was on the Democrat ticket. Because he feels like Kelly understands the border really well, and is his ally on the issue. So all in all, Kelly has the story, the swing state potential, the bipartisan likability, and strengthens us on our weakest issue.",Democrats,comment,lib,70
Love. Hes a great compliment to kamalas perceived weaknesses by the repubs.,Democrats,comment,lib,23
"Kelly is good since he protects one of Harris's biggest problems, being the border. Plus, Vice President Astronaut beats Vice President Couch Fucker any day",Democrats,comment,lib,19
"This is very superficial, but sadly that's the way lots & lots of people decide who to vote for... 

Kelly is amazing. I love him being in the Senate. But i saw a couple clips of him responding to Trump's racist rant about Kamala ""turning Black"" and ... well, it just wasn't very exciting. He had that staid, restrained, polite congressional tone you get from people like Chuck Schumer & Dick Durbin all the time. I feel like a moment like this needs someone who can crank up the energy to really hammer home the idea that Trump, Vance etc are a bunch of disgusting freaks. Maybe Shapiro or Buttigieg are more suited to that. Does any of that make sense?",Democrats,comment,lib,56
This would be an extremely powerful team.,Democrats,comment,lib,13
"Seems to me like the best option. Besides the obvious (astronaut, Gabby Giffords, swing state), Harris pretty clearly views the border as a major vulnerability and he's best positioned to deal with that. He's not the most dynamic communicator of the bunch but he seems good enough.",Democrats,comment,lib,11
"I don't think any of the picks are bad, but Kelly and Shapiro are the better ones. Kelly has popular appeal, likable. He seems a decent speaker, and can talk about the border. My only concern is that Trump will try to drag this guy and his family into the gutter. Trump is making this the dirtiest sleaziest campaign ever. I'm not sure if Kelly is prepared for that. Shapiro, being an ""East coast"" dude, I won't have such concerns about.",Democrats,comment,lib,90

"I like her record. She's got a long history of standing up for the downtrodden and opposing unjust laws. For example, she chose to flatly refuse to enforce prop 8, which was anti-gay marriage legislation in California. She also wrote an amicus brief to the supreme court, which seems to have played a major role in getting it overturned. She's done this with other stuff too, like the death penalty, or marijuana. The marijuana thing, where people keep saying she locked up 1900 black men is a fabrication. She convicted 1900 *people* over *seven years* for marijuana possession, and only about 45 of those came with any jail time at all. She has firm principles, and she sticks to them.

She also put a ton of effort into uplifting impoverished communities. She worked to reduce truancy (though some have criticized her methods), and she instituted a program where non-violent first offenders could get an education in lieu of jail time. She's of course also been a champion for women and the LGBTQ+ community in a whole host of ways. In terms of social issues, she's in lock step with me.

The only other thing I'll add about her record is that I think we've underestimated the role she's played in the Biden administration. I don't wanna steal Biden's thunder, but you can't convince me he directed the DOJ to reclassify marijuana on his own. Harris has been a proponent of legalization for a while now, and her record indicates she was a supporter for much longer, even if she wasn't outspoken about it. She's also the one who pushed for student loan forgiveness, which tracks with her focus on education.

Outside of that, she's charismatic, and she's played this entire thing so incredibly well. I have been so incredibly frustrated with the high-ground approach Democrats always seem to take. Since she's taken over, however, Democrats are on the offense. Trump has said and done so many things that should disqualify him as a candidate in voters' minds, but people have been treating it like an afterthought. Not anymore, and it's because Harris is a clear and effective communicator, and she's not afraid of a fight. I love Biden, and I think she'll have a hell of a time trying to live up to his legacy, but he could not make the case against Trump as his words have continued to fail him.

I dunno, I love Harris. She's so awesome. I was one of the naysayers before Biden stepped down, and I just started looking into her record to arm myself to defend the not-Trump candidate. But I've been absolutely blown away by how awesome her career has been. She's good people, and she's got a cast iron spine to stand up for what she believes in. She's the type of person I want in my corner without question. 

Biden saw what so many of us couldn't see when he picked her, and I'm so glad he did. She's exactly who we need right now, and I'm thrilled to have her represent and lead me.",Democrats,comment,lib,85

"I almost fell for the whole ""Harris is incompetent"" trick but she has had enough interviews now to prove she is informed and that the Right is just using ad hominem attacks on her character and questioning her heritage, the same tactics they used against Obama which I was strongly against then. It is continued headlines such as this combined with Trump's obvious refusal to treat Harris with any respect that brings me back to the Democrats. I never bought into the Republican party but as much as I hate to say it I was almost going to vote for the other side or sit this election out but my better instincts have prevailed after a lot of thought over the past week. My experiences trying to be politically active on X had the opposite effect I thought it would, it drew me back to the Left because I was able to sit down and really come back to terms with why people are so against Trump being the President again. I let my gut reaction to certain events cloud my logic for a time which I think is something that happens to the best of us in these crazy times.

And as much as the Right tries to downplay his behavior and call him a champion of freedom it really is just a smoke and mirror show. The Right has in a way been smart to engage with comedy figures and media personalities who are able to make light of serious issues and lower our defenses to what is really going on out there. These people are not competent and are trying to convince us that they should be in charge of the country and the military instead of those who have been involved in defending our country for decades.

"I found an article this morning on the news and the NYT published this story. Only for Andrew Bates, a Whitehouse press official to confirm it was a lie.

I've actually noticed that more recently, the media has portrayed everything anyone even left of the GOP as bad ever since the summer of 2021.

I want to put in my two cents after Professor Allan Lichtman stated a [few days ago on CNN about the media's complicity. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOET7XiyLro&t=80s)

For context, Dr. Lichtman has correctly predicted every election since 1984 with his formula, the 13 keys to the Whitehouse. And the formula works retroactively well as far back as 1860. Now before you say the 2000 prediction was wrong, no he was right in 2000 predicting the popular vote and of course, nobody expected the Florida debacle and the SCOTUS intervention.

In a nutshell, the professor IMHO is completely right, the media is complicit because where is the RNC demanding that Trump drops out for being a convicted felon? Or being found liable for r@ping E Jean Caroll? And even more recently documented proof he was on Epstein Island and r@ped children as young as 12. In addition, why didn't the moderators say anything during the debate? They could've said, ""Mr. Trump that is a lie."" Or ""Mr. Trump please answer the question."" But instead, they LET HIM LIE AND GASLIGHT his way throughout the entire debate.

Here are some things to remember in history. In 1984, Ronald Regan had a terrible first debate but he later went to win the presidency by a landslide. In 2004 Kerry also won every single debate against Bush but he lost the election, in 2012 Obama also had a terrible first debate but he won, and in 2016 Hillary Clinton won all 3 debates but lost the general election.

On paper the only folks this would clearly affect are NC voters who previously were on the fence about casting a ballot (i.e. unenthusiastic for Trump) but would have showed up for Robinson.

If they were going to vote before they're almost certainly still showing up. Maybe it eats away a small fraction of a percent from Trump.

Any other effects are purely speculative. The damage to the larger GOP brand could hurt Trump slightly with the fence-sitter demographic. Or you could have some folks who like the idea of splitting their ticket and decide to switch from Robinson/Harris to Stein/Trump (giving Trump an unintuitive boost). It's really hard to predict how this affects the top of the ticket - but also probably small enough to be negligible.

This is my husband. He is a Gulf War veteran. He worked 12 hours today as a mechanic (like he does every day). He came home, ate dinner, drank a beer, and helped me pack a few more boxes for our upcoming move out of this shitty apartment where we have lived for the last five years because housing is so freaking expensive where we live. (Obligatory fuck you to the greedy property management corps and Air BnBs who own goddamn everything around us). He is still wearing his dirty work uniform and is so tired that he hasn’t even showered yet because our work isn’t quite over for the day. He is taking a quick break to watch a few of the speeches before getting back to the task. He doesn’t complain though. No, he just does what he needs to do and then tomorrow he will wake up and start all over, all with kindness in his heart and a positive attitude. He is my rock. He is also tearing up watching Michelle and Barack Obama speaking last night. Those are happy tears. Tears of relief. Hope is such a powerful emotion.

They aren't talking about what group of people they want to marginalize next, whose rights they want to take away, or who is poisoning the blood of our nation, all of which are the center of Republican speeches.

The DNC is returning positivity to politics and BOY, do we need that.  The timing is perfect because at their core, most people want to be happy.  They want to feel hopeful.  Being angry all the time is exhausting and it's been that way for at least nine long years.

The part about Harris not being black until she ran for office is just bizarre. That's the first time I've seen anyone claim that Harris had considered herself Indian. FFS, she dated willie brown.

The most telling part of that particular diatribe though was how focused he was on dissecting her race. He just couldn't stop doing it. He was asked if she was a DEI hire and he could have simply said, ""I think that was a part of it, sure."" Or he could have doubled down and said ""Absolutely she was, she has a terrible record.""

(Obviously some do. I've seen one of my liberal friends share something fake as if it wasn't. But it's not characteristic of Democrats or essential to Democratic identity like being wrong is essential to Republican identity.)

I remember Republican party officers, candidates, and legislative staffers in my state regularly sharing fake or clearly-satirical stories as if they were real, including one story that explicitly stated it was satire in the image preview when posted on Facebook. (It was from the site, not some Facebook fact check element.) Another came from a website that had a story on the home page about a UAV with PTSD -- the machine itself, not the operator.

"You are correct- however there are some things that make it very different this time:

By almost all metrics, data, the indication is that in 2016, a lot of would've-been Hilary voters either didn't vote or wrote in Bernie Sanders, because they thought it was going to be so lopsided they didn't bother.

I think this time 

a) anybody not living under a rock has gotten the message to vote this time. If you have issues with Kamala, hold your nose and vote for her. Just do it. Anybody But Trump. 

b) there are some pretty blatant indications (knock on all the wood) that there are a lot of former Trump voters who are done with him, for a variety of reasons and will be voting Kamala, Third Party or just sitting this one out and not voting.

So, you've got tens of thousands if not millions more voting this time compared to 2016 and you've got a ton of former Trump voters who are now defectors to the democratic ticket, third parties or no vote.

She was NOT forecast to win in a landslide.,Democrats,comment,lib,44
"I've written this a few times but here's my take on why Trump won in 2016 and why he will never win again. 

1) Hillary's strategy was one of the worst in modern politics. Her campaign focused way too much on Florida and outright ignored the midwest, taking entire swaths of the country for granted.

2) Also there was a lot of bad will towards Hillary. The far left was mad that she was anointed and that the DNC essentially cut the legs out from Bernie. Meanwhile the right had been told nonstop for the last few years that she was satan incarnate. Benghazi and all that shit was on repeat on FOX News 24/7. Also if she would have won that means 24 out of the last 32 years of US history would have been a Clinton or a Bush in charge. Are only 2 fucking families allowed to run this country?

3) But even with all that she was predicted to win handedly. So a lot of people were like ""Eh, she's gonna win, might as well write in Bernie ... or vote for Jill Stein"". I personally know more than a few people that just assumed she would win and tried to vote 3rd party. They thought it was a layup to the point that they were like let's try to put a little effort to changing the system for next time. I mean everyone hates the 2 party system.

4) And on top of everything, Trump was coming in out of nowhere. He was funny. He was loud. And he wasn't a politician. He was going up against a career politician and he was like ""I'm not like them, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm an outsider"". And that message resonated. 

5) Plus we were coming off 8 relatively scandal-free years (at least compared to the last few presidents) with Obama. Things were going well, we'd gotten through the housing crisis (and hadn't hit the new housing crisis yet). There was an air of complacency so more than a few folks said ""fuck it, let the dog drive and lets see what happens"".

But that was his one chance. It was lightning in a bottle. 

He will never be able to play that ""outsider"" card again because we know he's not an outsider. He didn't drain the swamp, he tried to rule the swamp like a king. He's sell the copper pipes out of the white house if he could. We've seen over 8 years he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing or how to approach being a president. He doesn't know how to lead. He doesn't even know how to read. He's a mess with a very vocal very small fanbase. It's why practically every down ballot person he endorses loses. Because he's lost all clout and relevancy.

He will never sniff the white house again.",Democrats,comment,lib,11

I get that what happened that year was nothing less than psychologically traumatizing for anyone with a brain and / or heart... And I understand the desire to lock the whole experience in a box someplace in the back of your mind instead of expending the emotional energy it takes to revisit it and do an honest good faith dive into the reality of what we all lived through. But I'm telling ya'll there are lessons left on that table that we would do well to revisit and actually learn something from; and ""complacency"" isn't one of them.

Ignoring the absolute fact that 2016 was a once in a lifetime moment where all the stars aligned, and all the clouds formed a perfect orange shit storm of epic proportions...

Ignore the fact that the hate campaign against Hillary which dated all the way back to 1973 (if not 1969 when Life magazine covered her commencement speech) had poisoned the minds of so many and had countless people begging praying for ANY reason NOT to vote for her (which Comey shamefully provided)...

Just try to remember back and remind yourself how much fun the other side was having, even in the face of what should have been a complete and utter loss. It was the most braindead, repulsive, hate-filled, deplorable kind of fun, but dammit it was fun for them. Remember the coats? Remember the damn train bot? They were pissing into the wind, with not thought or care in the world what was gonna blow back on them, and you couldn't tell them they were gonna lose. They were the got damn living personification of ""Fake it till you make it.""

I wish sure wish we could take a little something from that. I don't think this whole Debbie Downer routine of sticking our fingers in our ears and lalalaing our way through the election is gonna get out a whole lot of the non-voters. But a little bit of good time damn well might. It's human nature to want to be on a winning team, and the bandwagon effect is a hell of a lot more supported by actual data than this silly idea of ""complacency""...

We got work to do, nobody is even trying to deny that. Literally NOBODY. But it isn't 2016 anymore; and it hasn't been 2016 since 2016 happened. Can we take the stick out of our collective ass and start having some got damn fun with it yet?",Democrats,comment,lib,16

"This message is correct.

But let's not forget :

A.) People that would have otherwise voted Dem were tuned out by Clinton.

B.) Clinton **ran a shit campaign**, seeing the election as a coronation rather than an election.

C.) I met/saw very very few enthusiastic Clinton voters. Most were more ""well it's a woman's turn"" type. Which was a really bad message.

D.) the DNC was dismissive of Progressive (ie, younger) voters, rather than embracing.

E.) Importantly, Trump was an unknown. Most people barely knew who he was. And even leading up to he election with the Access Hollywood tape and what have you, he payed defense that actually appealed to voters that might have otherwise been turned off by his statements (I am in no way defending what he said. I've always thought him, at best, to be a jackass. I am just saying what I saw).

F.) Comey and the FBI bullshit a month before the election **really hurt Clinton's campaign**. Frankly Comey should have been arrested for election interference. 

F 2.0) Obama knew more about the Russian (and others) influence on our elections, and unlike Comey decided to not meddle (ie, do what he could to counter the threat) in the election. Big mistake 

G.) Foreign influence, yes it is still happening, but we are much more attuned to it this time around. I don't really see ""fake news"" as big of a factor this time around. 2016, every bs article had plenty of questions behind it. Now most everything seems to be stupid...at best....and barely eye-roll worthy. 

H.) Lets be honest. Harris and Walz are a 1000X more likeable than Clinton/Kaine ever could be. Like it's not even close.

I.) Importantly, we have seen just how bad Trump can be. And thats even without the felonies and various other impending crimes. 

J.) Frankly ...a lot of Boomers and MAGAts died between then and now. The youth, especially Gen-Z who I see (in my little bubble) are pissed off and registering to vote. The kids are alright.

K.) Lastly, people are a lot more desperate than we were in 2016. Eight years of Obama had been pretty good it is overall. Took Orange Droolius less than four to really f--- that up for us.",Democrats,comment,lib,22

That unyielding support helps their candidates against Democrats whose base are full of high anxiety people always expecting near flawlessness quick to freak out and turn against their candidates.

I don't think all of the Democratic base is like that thankfully, I think the Democrats most reliable voters are less like that, while the people with the most free time to be chatting all day online and clicking and sharing articles are the former type and that's what we see online all the time, especially the past couple of days.

"“In blue states, the baby is delivered and the mother is given one last chance to request the abortion.”

Even the most dedicated pro-life person should be intelligent enough to recognize the absurdity of this statement, and that it is false, 100%. 

The good news? In the same conversation, the Trump talks about killing Roe v. Wade, he also talks about giving it back to the states, where they are allowed to have some very liberal rules regarding abortion. Similar to what we had before he killed Roe v. Wade. This alienates the pro lifers as well. The dumb fuck has managed to alienate both sides of the same issue. Because he is such a genius.",Democrats,comment,lib,214

Trump isn't doing this alone. He has a huge following in every channel of government and if all.we do is just the kingpin, there'll always be an underlying to pick up where he left off.

The President can only do so much without majorities in the chambers of government where bills are actually crafted and voted into law.

As an aside, this reality makes it all the more incredible just how much Biden actually DID get accomplished with one term, given the state of the House/Senate during his term.

Also don’t forget how the House members play games and with the GOP holding the majority, they will simply fight back and not introduce anything or vote with democrats on any legislation. This includes the budgets. They will literally hold him hostage if he increases the count to 13. This is probably the biggest reason he hasn’t  done it. 

You can bet Joe or Kamala will NEVER get one single vote from any republican ever if/when either of them decide to do this. 

So this in itself, as important as it is could change this nation dramatically and it is a MUST have scenario in both the House and the Senate to have the votes and not be held back by republicans.

Many of which seem to be single issue (immigration/border) voters too. I’ve actually looked at stats, read overviews of the bills,  and watched these bills flop - and you absolutely cannot reason with them. They have their own sets of alternative facts that they prefer to work with because their own confirmation bias is too cozy to resist.

The alt-right is a minority group in the US and as such needs to garner a goodly number of independent voters in order to swing the election their way.  Fortunately for the rest of us, independent voters have been turning away from the ravings of Trump.  I'm not saying they are enthusiastic about supporting Biden either, but they aren't showing the same support for Trump.

If we remind voters that a vote for Biden not only is a vote for him, but for his staff and his policies it could blunt the ageism blade that the right has been wielding with abandon; never mind that on Election Day Biden will be 81 and Trump will be 78, just a 3 year difference.

We also still have plenty of folks here who aren't happy with the reversal of Roe v Wade and the Conservatives are continuing to push unpopular policies like declaring that IVF embryos are humans and that their destruction could result in prosecution.  They also blew up the best border bill they've ever had.  The result is they may be gaining more vocal support from the far right (a group that is going to vote Trump regardless), but they are alienating large swaths of the American population.

So you can have all the Democrats you want in California and they’re only gonna get so many votes. This is why Trump won without winning the popular vote in 2017.

Trump is potentially the next “Mein Fuhrer”, and if you don’t want to live in a world where that’s the case, if you don’t want the fruits of AI to go to one individual, for China to seize Taiwan and then the rest of the democratic world crumble under the mighty tyrannical triumvirate, then recognize the fucking threat and do something about it. We’re living in 1933 Germany before Hitler was elected chancellor. He didn’t even win the popular vote, and he used voter intimidation, and nobody stopped him.

"The problem is that society moves forward. If you look back over time you see that eventually progress always wins. It has to do with how younger generations learn the good from the older gens and come to recognize the bad and tend to reject it. Thus over time society shifts and changes. 

Meanwhile there are people that hold to older ideas either out of dogmatic reasons or an inability to adapt. Add in the older generations that can't pick up on the errors of their ways. And over time these people tend to build up on the backside of society moving forward. And they begin to feel oppressed (ironically because they can't oppress people any longer). And they feel as though they are losing control of society (because they are). And whether it is their dogma or their cultural ignorance they fear that the change is destroying everything. 

So they get angry. Pissed off. They start rejecting the institutions that support the advances such as science and medicine. They become increasingly isolated from reality building bubbles of their own beliefs. And become increasingly mad at the world. 

So when a grifter comes along, particularly a narcissistic one that is desperate for adoration, they are going to say whatever the crowd wants to hear. Most politicians practice nuance. They are desperate not to piss off anyone that might vote for them. So they couch their comments in safe speeches. They practice saying a lot of words that mean nothing in reality. Or they talk about complex ideas that require a deep understanding of issues. 

All the MAGA base knows is that they are pissed. Hearing nuance of any sort pisses them off more. They feel like the world is being yanked out from under them by nuance. So when a thug like trump speaks to them he comes off as glib and charismatic. And he quickly learns what words get him the adoration he craves. And they become welded to him like the plates of a submarine at depth. 

Add into the mix decades of the GOP and Conservatives deliberately trying to undermine science and experts and funding Think Tanks that do the same thing.

now, after everything he has done to this country, trump has the fucking audacity to run for president again as if we would want him back. this man who attempted to overthrow the government when it became quite apparent that he had lost.  
  
if you vote for him, you will be committing treason. you will be helping someone who attempted to overthrow the government be put back into a position where he could do it again. if he gets reelected, every single person who voted for him will be guilty of treason and, if there was any justice in the world, they would be tried and convicted for it. i don't care how authoritarian i sound. that is the truth of the matter.

""There are 4 central efforts outlined in the indictment regarding Trump and his allies’ efforts to overturn the will of the voters and undermine the results of the 2020 Georgia presidential election.

These include:

Efforts to get Georgia officials to invalidate or nullify the will of Georgia voters, including by “finding” votes that did not exist

The scheme to get 16 fake electors in Georgia to cast fraudulent electoral college votes for Trump, even though Trump did not win the popular vote in the state

Intimidating, harassing, and threatening Georgia elections workers based on false accusations and in an effort to influence their testimony as witnesses

Tampering with county voting machines

All 19 defendants, including Trump, are charged with criminal racketeering under Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which ties together individual criminal acts into a broader criminal network and conspiracy.

The Fulton County, Georgia indictment was brought by a grand jury of everyday citizens convened by DA Fani Willis. DA Willis is a highly respected veteran prosecutor who has been investigating Trump and his allies efforts to meddle with the 2020 election for more than two-and-a-half years. 

The grand jury heard from many witnesses, including state officials who were asked by Trump and his allies to help overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

"My Mom (RIP) once told me that when someone shows you who they are the first time?

Believe them.

Candidate Trump keeps telling us who he is since forever.

Here are some recent statements:

■ He talks about Hannibal Lector (a fictional character) with admiration.

>*In a campaign speech in New Jersey earlier this year, Trump segued from an unsubstantiated claim about migrants coming from “insane asylums” to the discussing the cannibal psychiatrist, who was created by novelist Thomas Harris. ""Has aone ever seen ‘The Silence of the Lambs’? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He’s a wonderful man. He oftentimes would have a friend for dinner. Remember the last scene? ‘Excuse me, I’m about to have a friend for dinner,’ as this poor doctor walked by. ‘I’m about to have a friend for dinner.’ But Hannibal Lecter. Congratulations. The late, great Hannibal Lecter,” Trump said at the earlier rally.*

The shock from the actor who portrayed the character is one of the things we all think about.


>*Actor Anthony Hopkins says he is “shocked and appalled” by former President Trump’s comments about fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter, whom Hopkins won an Oscar portraying in the 1991 movie “The Silence of the Lambs.” ""Hannibal, that’s a long time ago that movie,” Hopkins said in a Deadline interview published Tuesday in response to hearing about Trump’s remarks. “God, that was over 30 years ago. I’m shocked and appalled what you’ve told me about Trump.” Trump has repeatedly praised Lecter, calling him “a wonderful man.”*

■ He thinks President Obama is the current POTUS.

>*Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to President Joe Biden as ""Obama,"" most recently in a campaign speech Saturday. ""Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he’s starting to throw around the nuclear word,"" Trump said at a rally in Virginia on Saturday. He later added, ""We have a fool as a president.""*

■ He states, basically once I'm in office, you don't have to vote again.

>*Democrats have expressed outrage after Donald Trump told a group of Christian supporters on Friday that if he wins the presidency in November, they would never need to vote again. ""Christians, get out and vote, just this time,” the former president and current presidential nominee told the crowd at at Turning Point Action’s Believers’ Summit on Friday. “You won’t have to do it any more. Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine, you won’t have to vote any more, my beautiful Christians.”*

■ Fred Trump III, his nephew, has come forward now and his thoughts succinctly describe Candidate Trump as ""atomic crazy'

>*Fred Trump III, the nephew of former President Donald Trump, said his uncle is ""atomic crazy,"" that he witnessed him using racial slurs decades ago -- and that he plans to vote for Kamala Harris. The Trump way was to be ""complex and sometimes cruel,"" Fred Trump said in an interview with ABC News' Aaron Katersky. ""And within every family -- people know this -- families are complicated. Every family has their crazy uncle. My Uncle Donald is atomic crazy. And … he has put his mark on the family history,"" he said, as he promoted his new book, ""All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way.""*

All you have to do is use your browser. 

There are too many crazy statements and insane actions to mention.

Candidate Trump is ... not right in the head.

They try pointing him to where he needs to go and he says loudly, ""I'm not here to vote. I'm here to get a vote count."" 

A poll worker across from him asks who he is. ""I'm John Smith. I'm the [important position] for the 123 congressional district GOP."" I don't remember all of his credentials.

The poll worker asks if he has a letter stating his representation. John Smith repeats his long flowing title again. The poll worker says, ""I heard that, but if you don't have a letter stating your representation, then you need to leave.""

"Oh boy...I seem oddly qualified to add some context to this.

I currently work for Texas Health and Human Services. I am not a worker that interviews customers, but I interact with them enough that I have a good idea of whats going on.

The article mentions that Texas HHSC is underfunded and understaffed. This is very accurate. While it has gotten slightly better recently, it is definitely not enough to handle the sheer volume of people that need help. There have been a few rounds of recent hiring sprees, but ultimately the issue comes down to a bottleneck in infrastructure to support the new hires. Again, some improvements recently, but not nearly enough.

I don't doubt that someone in Austin made the decision that another program would overwhelm the current system as the workers handling the SNAP program are already overwhelmed as it is. And that is counting AFTER the recent hiring initiatives.

Ultimately, the best solution to this would be one that I highly doubt the GOP controlled State government would be willing to do. Support assistance programs in general and dump a decent amount of cash into them to allow them to be able to handle the significantly overtaxed programs that are already in place.

Last note: Probably an overhaul on the requirements to simplify determining who qualifies for programs would also lighten the load on workers that handle programs like SNAP. Some of those requirements make no sense these days.",Liberal,comment,lib,60

Total science-fantasy, I know. We're nowhere *near* accomplishing an artificial entity like that.

I've wracked my brain before looking for a better way to have a Supreme Court than the flawed and easily gamed and biased system we have now. The best I've ever been able to imagine would be to have 4 firmly 'conservative' Justices, 4 firmly 'liberal' Justices, and one firmly 'neutral' Justice; the problem being how can any mortal human being ever be 'neutral' and 'unbiased'? I don't think it's possible, so the whole idea falls on it's face. 😞

I suppose another idea would be to have term limits for SCOTUS Justices, instead of it being a lifetime appointment?

The idea has also been floated to *expand* the Supreme Court to some other odd number (11, 13, 15? More?). I can see the merit to that idea: more Judicial opinions, more chances for things to average out to something resembling 'politically unbiased'.

He tweeted 35,000 times while in office.

The chaos is him. It has always been him. This is what he wants for our country; complete focus on him. The fist bump after he left the stage confirms it; he loved that this happened because it plays right into his bullshit tough guy narrative and it enables him to command all the attention. 

During 2020 rioting in Minneapolis, Seattle, Kenosha, etc., governors and mayors in these local areas were begging him to shut the fuck up because he makes the conflict worse every time he opens his mouth. It is simply what he does.

Two-time impeached felony Candidate Trump and has never respected our military.

And in case people forget? 

The  plan to withdraw from Afghanistan was made by then President Trump in 2020, before President Biden was elected. He and his administration wrote the plan. Read the terms that President Trump prepared.

President Biden had to honor it.

>*The U.S. withdrawal was set in motion as part of a [February 2020 peace deal -- click here to read the agreement President Trump](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/29/810537586/u-s-signs-peace-deal-with-taliban-after-nearly-2-decades-of-war-in-afghanistan) signed with the Taliban during the Trump administration. The Biden administration missed the May 1, 2021, deadline outlined in the original deal, but promised to honor the terms of the withdrawal deal before Sept. 11 of that year.*

Then President Trump sent additional troops, which he said he would never do.

>*President Trump has repeatedly vowed to end America's involvement in the war in Afghanistan, the most prolonged of all U.S. conflicts. Within months of assuming the presidency, though, Trump added 4,000 U.S. troops to the 8,900 American forces already deployed there.*

We left equipment and documents and people behind.

>*He warns this agreement cannot repeat what the U.S. signed with the North Vietnamese in the 1973 Paris peace talks, ""where we basically take on faith that the enemy is going to behave itself once we're gone.""*

We lost 2,400 Americans. Did President Trump take it on faith they would behave themselves once we withdrew?

And now look what happened.

"Why the hell is warning people that they have the power to stop Trump by voting blue so controversial?Shouldn't we be shoving it down their throats until they come to reason? I tried asking this on ask liberal and had my posts blocked and even once here.

I'm referring to of course far left and centrists who would normally vote blue, but are refusing to in swing states specifically.  It's like they don't seem to care about Trump, or realize just how worse he will be if they let him win. Not the Trump voters that are impossible to convert. And in 


Reddit is the only place where the average person can reach a large amount of people. But why are even liberal subs refusing to listen?

I'm so sick of the same arguments over and over. Our democracy and American lives are more important than anything else right now. Don't blackmail us with a dictator and hold us literally hostage.

(It's not being a bully to warn about a very real threat, its like saying scientists are bullying you over climate change, the only way to get people to listen is to be aggressive about it)

I have trans family members lives on the line here. 

And I rely on Medicaid/ssi which Republicans want to get rid of, I'm physically disabled and can no longer work due to an injury. It might not be their campaign chopping block promise, but If some of the hard core anti socialist republican congress get their way, it will be. Frankly, I don't know how anyone who relies on it can vote Republican, and I especially can't understand a so called liberal being ok about the risk of  losing it by refusing to vote/vote third party and letting Trump win.

PROJECT 2025 is all anyone should care about right now.",Liberal,post,lib,370
"First thing to say is that it's not a controversial opinion. That doesn't mean everyone is going to adopt it.

Second thing is that regardless of the validity of their answer, you telling everyone to shut up and fuck off if it isn't what you want to hear is at the core of the issue, only it's not just you. 

There are significantly sized populations that while they aren't conservatives have had their concerns and issues ignored for prolonged years. The gap between someone like Trump and someone like Biden is legitimately less than it is for the average person that's getting at least something of their concerns addressed. The promises that their turn will come have been delayed if not forgotten entirely. 

The thing that Democrats need to do an even better job of doing is being the big tent party, not just in comparison to Republicans but in a more fundamental comprehensive way. They need to start listening to these neglected groups and make progress on the topics they care about. The number of votes available to Democrats with this undertaking could be in the millions.

"What we should be doing is whatever works for the given situation. The goal has to be about results and not just getting our feelings off our chests or making ourselves feel superior.

For example - if you're talking to someone who agrees about the dangers of a second Trump term but isn't convinced their vote matters then, yes, hammering away might be effective.

OTOH, when dealing with the under informed masses  (or even misinformed Trump voters) I've found it far more productive to look for common ground or slowly walk them through their own views in a non-theatening way (I.e. ""Of course grooming kids is wrong - but why, exactly, do you think that's happening?""). Even if you can't get them to do an ideological 180 a lot of times you can make inroads. 

Like, I just can't respect a hardcore Trump supporter. But if treating them as if I do helps deflate their outrage - even temporarily - that's probably a win (maybe one less political donation, a few days of not sharing conspiracies, and a longshot chance that they actually reflect on what they truly believe). Alternatively, I can point out the hard truths about how absolutely moronic their views are and how their lack of critical thinking has earned them a place amongst the worst fascist sympathizers in history - and put them to go on the defensive which will only further entrench their views.

Just know your audience. If you don't think they're reachable don't waste your time. If you do think you can make even a slight impact then approach it pragmatically. I do think a lot of progressives with good intentions end up making things worse because they let their own frustrations guide their interactions and it ends up strengthening the types of views that we ought to be trying to eradicate.",Liberal,comment,lib,10

"Because people who are doing harm by their actions (or by failing to act) don’t want to hear it!   Most people want to think that they’re good people, and therefore become fragile at the suggestion that they might be doing harm!  So they try to turn it into something “controversial.”


Also, those who say “both sides are the same” (or similar) usually are coming from a place of privilege or advantage!   It’s usually (not always, but usually) straight white guys, because losing abortion rights, LGBT+ rights, etc doesn’t affect THEM!  (Or they perceive it doesn’t).  


Finally, it’s NOT bullying to say these things!   (It could be argued that it’s ineffective, but that’s NOT the same thing).  It’s NOT automatically bullying if someone disagrees with you.  Or if they point out that you’re actively doing harm.  It’s uncomfortable to hear, but uncomfortable is NOT automatically bullying!",Liberal,comment,lib,11
"Your problem may be your approach. It comes across as old man yelling at the sky with a mix of leftist teenage angst.

I have seen plenty of posts and responses on Reddit subs and SM comments saying the same sentiment, ""vote blue no matter who"" without getting blocked, removed, muted, or shouted down. It is not controversial.

Reddit is largely left leaning anyway, so you are in effect, preaching to the choir. And most of these people don't like being preached at.

Now if you want to have a discussion on party voting across a ticket, make sure you are not hypocritical when a bunch of low information voters check that (R) for the same reasons you are hollering about and elect the likes of MTG, Lindsey Graham, and Jim Jordan.

As an aside, the GOP platform does **not** include ""getting rid of"" Medicaid or SSI, unless you are suggesting that Rick Scott is now a party leader.

"I'm so fucking tired of the right's insistence that they're ""protecting the children.""Seriously, I'm fucking tired of it. They claimed they were ""protecting the children"" with abortion bans. Now they're claiming to ""protect the children"" by banning healthcare for transgender kids.

You want to know what I think? I think it's all bullshit. They don't actually care about children. I live in Idaho, a state that has atrocious abortion bans and has banned gender-affirming care for minors. Not only did they ban gender-affirming care for minors by the way, they decided to kick adults receiving said care off of medicaid too. 

Fuck the right. They do not care about children. All they fucking care about is harming and killing those they don't like. It sounds like an exaggeration when I say that but it's true. They go through these roundabout ways to oppress people via the law because they can get away with it. They know damn well that abortion bans and denying healthcare for those transgender individuals who need it will result in more deaths. THAT'S THE FUCKING POINT.

For the right, I think, kids are more like raw material. They are fiercely protective of the kids that they believe can be molded into future versions of themselves, particularly as regards to anything or one that might pull them off that path. The rest, to them, are disposable,  or at best, someone else's problem. And any child of theirs that does stray from their tribe can be, indeed must be, discarded.

"So here’s the paper itself. And it is, as they say, problematic—the estimate of 26,000 rape-related pregnancies in Texas. The state seems to have 13,000 reported rapes a year. We think it’s unlikely that each rape leads to two pregnancies. But, yes, of course, we know that rape is an under-reported crime. So it is actually possible that the number of pregnancies from rape is higher than the number of reported rapes. Well, maybe. But it’s possible to check this number the other way around. Before Dobbs, Texas reported about 50,000 abortions a year. Yes, the study period here is slightly longer than a year, but 26,000 out of 50,000 is a really high proportion. If this new number is true, then that means that 50%, half, of Texas abortions were the result of rape.

That’s not a believable number.

Or, we can look at the national numbers. This new paper says that 65,000 rape-caused pregnancies happened in only the 14 states that have restricted abortion. That’s their claim. But others have looked at this (the National Library of Medicine) before abortion was this post-Dobbs political issue and concluded that there are about 30,000 rape-related pregnancies per year in the whole country. The new claim is, remember, that only in the states with abortion restrictions the new number is over twice the old national number.

Like that piece that contained a slew of jabs and faulting the Democrats for Trump, so does this. He claims if Trump wins, there ""will be a violent reaction around the country from the far left"". Come on! When has this happened? Remember the pink hat protest? It was one of the biggest in history and it was peaceful.

""A people so divided cannot continue forward without addressing their divisions openly; otherwise, they should peaceably separate, or spiral toward a violent end."" This is ridulously fatalistic. First of all, this isn't the north and south of the Civil War. It's impossible to ""peaceably separate the country"". So the only other option is a ""violent end"". Thankfully Miles is no longer in the federal government making decisions for us.

He claims the only solution is for citizens to demand ""system-wide reforms to make our democracy more representative of all views and less prone to upheaval"". As a Republican, I can guarantee he isn't advocating for the removal the electoral college or the ability to gerrymander. In a time period of such deep divisions, when one party in power is tightly in the grip by someone outside the goverment who threatens their very lives, this is a ridiculous solution. Would that have been possible during Hitler's ascent? Hardly.

Many voters don’t follow politics closely. As the election approaches, they’ll learn more about Trump and be less inclined to vote for him.

"I'm CAUTIOUSLY optimistic Biden will beat Trump again, for some reasons:

1) Incumbents have an inherent advantage, especially over folks they've beaten before.

2) Americans have HINDSIGHT this time around.

3) The GOP platform alienates most independents and moderates, which Trump would need for a victory.  Every election, a candidate needs their base AND the independent/moderate/undecided vote.  They can't win with their base alone.

4) Polls are biased or skewed towards those that actually TAKE said polls.  Mostly only older individuals partake in them.  Actually, the fact that Biden keeps even with him should be encouraging by that logic, whether he's above or below.  Trump can't pull out far enough ahead.  And most pollsters put up numbers to make the race APPEAR closer for ratings.

5) Trump's legal woes drain money from him that he COULD'VE used for campaigning.  So he won't get as much airtime and advertising.  He'd be weaker here than either 2016 or 2020.

6) The GOP is making the same mistakes that lost them the 2022 Midterms, doubling down on oppressive religious, racist, or reactionary legislation, which would alienate many minorities and women.

7) Prof. Allan Lichtman, a guy who's correctly predicted elections since 1984 with his ""13 Keys to the White House"" methodology says the 'Keys' favor Biden again this time around.  While I don't think he's made an actual official prediction YET, he says a Biden re-election is at least decently likely.

Harris is spending - and raising - way more than Trump,Liberal,post,lib,354

The massive spending disparity came even as the Trump campaign continued to scale up its expenses, which more than doubled from the month prior, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance filings submitted to the Federal Election Commission late Friday. But the continued divergence highlights the Harris campaign’s significant money and infrastructure advantage as the election approaches: Harris has far more campaign cash available than Trump, and she has greater means to deploy it.*

Well?

She does not have his legal bills.

■ She is *NOT* being:

• audited by the IRS, 

• worrying about upcoming criminal trials or past felony convictions, 

• paying for fines and other money (interest going up daily) owed to a woman he sexually attacked.

■ She opens her mouth, and the truth comes out.

I think, honestly, democrats handled that “slight sign of trouble” pretty well. They said “the polling will improve” and “when America sees how bad trump is, we’ll do better”. If anything, I think they may have UNDERreacted to the “slight sign of trouble”.

The debate was an eye opening moment for a lot of people that we don’t have a candidate that CAN turn things around.

What a complete pile of horseshit...

First of all stimulus from public tax payers saved their asses from losing their jobs forever.

Secondly, hindsight is 20/20, over a million people died and we know 200K of them unnecessarily due to lack of vaccination and masking protocols by a minority of ignorant people. Simple harmless things that could help everyone were ignored to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths. Vaccines were never dangerous and masks flat out worked which is why there was no regular flu season for almost two straight years.

So, never before is it more important to remind people that their freedom is not absolute and must coexist and not intrude on other people's freedoms. You cannot knowingly carry a potentially deadly disease into a public place where you can easily spread it and expect people to respect your decision...that's just not going to happen.

However pushing the older gens forward takes effort. And not everyone advances at the same pace. So there is buildup regressing against the progress. And as it builds up it pushes back more and more. Until the damn breaks. And usually what happens is that the ugliness inherent to the regressive stance is shown to all the world. Unfortunately this is often tied to conflict even rising to the point of war. But to date progress wins. 

Its not a pendulum though. Progress doesn't win without a lot of people working their asses off to drag things forward. So its not something we can just wait for. Waiting is just putting the responsibility in other people's hands later on. And in the mean time a lot of people will be hurt by the regressive push back.

\-Reagan was the 'fix' for Carter doldrums while repairing damage from LBJ, Nixon and Ford.

"Also. Since they mailed it.  Isn’t there a law about that? Because it could be considered a threat. Please read…


From US Postal Inspection Service website:
Have you ever received a letter that scared you or threatened to destroy your reputation? Mailings like this are a serious federal crime. If you receive a threatening letter, report it to Postal Inspectors and keep the letters as evidence. A more modern version of a threat letter is called cyberbullying. The effects of cyberbullying are in many ways worse than traditional bullying, infiltrating every part of a victim’s life and causing a variety of psychological struggles.

Threatening Letters
It’s a serious federal crime to use the mail to threaten a person. Watch to learn more about the threatening letters and cyberbullying that Postal Inspectors investigate.

"""He's so awful he makes her look Reaganesque""

That's basically what I said to someone yesterday. Harris and her plans really aren't that crazy or radical. Trump has gone so far to the right that this is just basic shit most people want to live. Who is the one really supporting family values? What is the most radical thing? The $25k for first time home buyers? Really not radical considering we gave out GI loans after ww2. Those GI loans helped my grandfather buy their house, my grandparents raised 3 kids and took care of their aging parents. The benefits of homeownership from that GI loan are still benefitting my family to this day! The GI bills also helped with unemployment, education, and job training. It helped obtain education benefits for 7.8 million veterans. The GI bill was a major contribution to the U.S. stock of human capital and encouraged long-term economic growth. 

This is good to see. We need to keep putting the work in and not get complacent. It's frustrating because this is literally what we have been trying to tell them for years now, but it is encouraging af to finally see this getting through to people.

"Why I'm voting for Kamala Harris as a single issue 2A republican For the last 21 years that I've been able to vote, I've voted straight ticket republican every election. I'll admit that I was a single issue voter, and my sole priority was protecting the second amendment (even today, it still is a very important issue to me, but I'll explain more later). 

I voted for Trump in 2016 and in 2020, but January 6 combined with Trumps felony business fraud conviction and his sexual assault case were my come to Jesus moments and  this time I'm not making that mistake. 

Trump is a liar, a traitor, a coward, and a criminal. He has no business holding public office ever again. I see the danger that he poses to our republic if he is given power and we need to come together as a country to put a stop to him once and for all (hopefully, though I wouldn't put a 2028 run past him if he's still alive.

This was not an easy decision. And I certainly  have my grievances with the Harris/Walz position on guns, but I recognize 2 key things that I think other Republicans that also don't want Trump back but are also hesitant to vote for Harris don't realize: 

1. Because our republic/democracy and the rule of law are respected under a Harris presidency, any new policies, be it guns or something else, can be challenged in court. If Trump wins, he'll just do whatever the hell he wants with no regard for acting within the law. 
I'd rather fight Harris in court over a policy I don't like than fight Trumps minions in the street over democracy as we know it.

2. What a politician wants to do, what they can do, what you can reasonably expect to happen in a term, what actually happens, and what actually happens that dosent get struck down or limited by the courts are very different things. 

While I know we probably disagree heavily on this, I hope we can work together in the coming months to focus on the immediate threat, Trump. He must never be given power ever again.

Edit: 

People, if you want to try and argue gun policy with me, DM me, and I'll happily get back to you at my earliest convenience, but that's not my intention for my post in this subreddit. I'm here in good faith because Trump sent policy disagreements to the bottom of my list of worries with this upcoming election. ",KamalaHarris,post,lib,6530

"Welcome, and thank you. I too was a lifelong Republican until the orange stain came along. I voted 3rd party in 2016 because neither major party option was remotely acceptable to me. Voted Biden in 2020, without much enthusiasm but for the very reasons you cite now, I recognized that the dump posed a major threat to our nation, whereas with Biden it would be, at worst I figured, just plain old govt. ineptitude, not actual malice (and have been very pleasantly surprised that, lo and behold, the guy did a dang good job under the conditions, although he spent too much money (but so did DonOld). You’re absolutely right, it is hyperbole and propaganda that the right wing spews about the left, and nothing disastrous is actually going to become law. And it’s super obvious why they do it - they know their own positions - banning abortion etc, banning books, imposing Christianity in the classroom, stripping voting rights, more tax breaks for the wealthiest among us, dumbing down education, stripping away as much of the social safety net as possible - are utterly unacceptable to the vast majority of Americans. So the only way they can win is to deflect and project and claim the other side is satan. Again, thank you for your willingness to examine and, as warranted, change your views. It is the mark of a mature and intelligent human being. 
P.S. once we sweep out the orange trash, we can get to work on rebuilding a principled, respectable Republican Party, because democracy needs at least two functioning parties to survive and no one party or philosophy has all the answers.",KamalaHarris,comment,lib,25

In this country, you have to have it. But when you talk about those numbers, compared to the kind of numbers that I'm talking about by taxing foreign nations at levels that they're not used to, but they'll get used to it very quickly, and it's not going to stop them from doing business with us, but they'll have a very substantial tax when they send product into our country. Those numbers are so much bigger than any numbers that we're talking about, including childcare, that it's going to take care -- we're going to have -- I look forward to having no deficits within a fairly short period of time, coupled with the reductions that I told you about on waste and fraud and all of the other things that are going on in our country, because I have to say, with childcare, I want to stay with childcare. But those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just, that I just told you about. We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, it's relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in. We're going to make this into an incredible country that can afford to take care of its people, and then we'll worry about the rest of the world. Let's help other people. But we're going to take care of our country first. This is about America first. It's about Make America great again.

'As much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we’ll be taking in.'""

"For Everyone Here: What Did You Think of The First Day of The DNC? Personally, I was Absolutely Blown Away by How Genuinely Fantastic it Was.Almost everyone who spoke at the event did an absolutely incredible job of conveying a far more positive and upbeat beat Democratic Party since Biden dropped out.

I was also very happy to see AOC and Peggy Flanagan speaking there alongside Raphael Warnock and several Civil Rights Activists. 

I was also incredibly happy to hear support for a ceasefire in Gaza from tons of the prominent speakers there. It was genuinely heartwarming to hear it getting such positive reception from within the DNC in general.

The constant hammering against Project 2025 was very good to see as well. I am to say the very least absolutely elated it is finally being taken seriously for the massive threat it is to our entire country. The bit with Mallory McMorrow from Michigan especially was absolute comedy gold with the massive Project 2025 book.

What was your favorite part of the first day of the DNC and who were some of your favorite speakers?",KamalaHarris,post,lib,6246
"I loved it. It had a great mix of people from all walks of life and different parts of the country. Not just white washed up stars of yesteryear like Hulk Hogan **BROTHER** and Kid Rock.

The DNC really did a great job on one of their biggest weaknesses in messaging, hammering home points such as reproductive rights, American made manufacturing jobs, the future, and why fighting and voting is key. As well as going directly after Trump, instead of taking the high road. I loved the Democratic party taking the gloves off and hitting back.

I loved how they really put over Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, gave Joe Biden his flowers, and pushed future stars and people who can be President one day like a Reverend Warnock or Governor Andy Beshear.

"So we're not going to let this happen again, right?So as the time gets closer and anxiety builds my mind wonders. I thought about Jan 6, and how it all happened. We all know that this probably went as far because the ring leader was on the inside allowing it. That won't happen this time. Biden/Harris are in charge and I know they are aware of it too. I'm sure a military presence will be there this time. 

My thought process is, are we really going to stand by and let this happen again? These fools will show up again. These fools will cause trouble. When do we gather in appropriate numbers and stop the violent take over that is going on? 

More people voted blue in 2017, and 2020. Blue needs to stand up for their rights! We need to be there for our leader and let these idiots know that WE HAVE a presence! WE HAVE a voice! And They do not get to bully themselves to the top. 

Take this picture of Jan 6, and insert +1 million Blue Democracy Savors in the front lines. Who knows how this would go down. We can't let them get the chance. Win or lose these losers will show up and I for one will too. We have to let the world know we don't stand for this shit! These idiots made us look like clowns to the world and are the reason this is still happening. 

If they want a peaceful tour of the capital in January this year, they need to get through every last one of us first!!! ✊️ We can't go back! We won't! Victory is the only option. Landslide! But if you're sick to death of domestic terrorism, this is your time to rise to the occasion. These cockroaches have no spine or heart. They back down at a moments notice when it gets real. They got caught up in 2021, but when a blue wall is there first, and there bigger and stronger, and there with true American spirit - that will be the end of this nightmare. 

I am not suggesting we bring violence at all. But in that picture, they showed up. We sat at home and watched. We watched them beat, break, smash, and kill their way in. I say if they were to start that march to the capital this time, knowing there was 1 million of us waiting for them. This Will Not Happen Again!

"**Taylor Swift on Instagram:**

>Like many of you, I watched the debate tonight. If you haven’t already, now is a great time to do your research on the issues at hand and the stances these candidates take on the topics that matter to you the most. As a voter, I make sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country.

>Recently I was made aware that AI of ‘me’ falsely endorsing Donald Trump’s presidential run was posted to his site. It really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation. It brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter. The simplest way to combat misinformation is with the truth.

>I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades.

>I’ve done my research, and I’ve made my choice. Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make. I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered! I also find it’s much easier to vote early. I’ll link where to register and find early voting dates and info in my story.

>With love and hope,

I’m almost 40 and vowed to stay out of all politics through my entire life but after seeing it daily for 15 years in the military and growing up in backwoods Florida, I’m done ignoring it. I raised by religious republicans who ingrain every part of their lives with their political affiliation. I pass half a dozen MAGA stickers driving anywhere through town. The mean old man across the street has a “the family in this house loves god, guns, and Trump flag” (he is single). My grandpa even built a shed and etched something like “this isn’t Obamas, it’s mine” in the slab. I avoid social media and this is the even first thing I’ve ever felt the need to post on here. 

I’ve always ignored it and just told myself my vote really doesn’t count anyways, until 2 weeks ago when I finally registered to vote and I plan to vote for Harris. I don’t care if my vote does nothing to sway the election. I’m just tired of all the hate created by the Right. Do I think either side cares about me? Not really. I just want to know I did my part to cancel a Trump vote and attempt to end this hate that seems to be growing. It’s not healthy and I don’t want my kids to inherit this mess. Hopefully others feel the same way and finally vote as well. 

I think I can edit here. Holy crap! I got off work and was just scrolling Reddit and was like why do I have hundreds  of messages in my inbox?

"# [RONALD REAGAN:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R8QxCD6ir8)

>Now, tomorrow is a special day for me. I'm going to receive my gold watch. And since this is the last speech that I will give as President, I think it's fitting to leave one final thought, an observation about a country which I love. It was stated best in a letter I received not long ago. **A man wrote me and said: You can go to live in France, but you cannot become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan, but you cannot become a German, a Turk, or a Japanese. But anyone, from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in America and become an American.**

>Yes, the torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom and represents our heritage, the compact with our parents, our grandparents, and our ancestors. It is that lady who gives us our great and special place in the world. For it's the great life force of each generation of new Americans that guarantees that America's triumph shall continue unsurpassed into the next century and beyond. Other countries may seek to compete with us; but in one vital area, as a beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws the people of the world, no country on Earth comes close.

>This, I believe, is one of the most important sources of America's greatness. We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people -- our strength -- from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation. While other countries cling to the stale past, here in America we breathe life into dreams. We create the future, and the world follows us into tomorrow. Thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we're a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge, always leading the world to the next frontier. This quality is vital to our future as a nation. If we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.

>A number of years ago, an American student traveling in Europe took an East German ship across the Baltic Sea. One of the ship's crewmembers from East Germany, a man in his sixties, struck up a conversation with the American student. After a while the student asked the man how he had learned such good English. And the man explained that he had once lived in America. He said that for over a year he had worked as a farmer in Oklahoma and California, that he had planted tomatoes and picked ripe melons. It was, the man said, the happiest time of his life. Well, the student, who had seen the awful conditions behind the Iron Curtain, blurted out the question, \`\`Well, why did you ever leave?'' \`\`I had to,'' he said, \`\`the war ended.'' The man had been in America as a German prisoner of war.

>Now, I don't tell this story to make the case for former POW's. Instead, I tell this story just to remind you of the magical, intoxicating power of America. We may sometimes forget it, but others do not. Even a man from a country at war with the United States, while held here as a prisoner, could fall in love with us. Those who become American citizens love this country even more. And that's why the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp to welcome them to the golden door.

>**It is bold men and women, yearning for freedom and opportunity, who leave their homelands and come to a new country to start their lives over. They believe in the American dream. And over and over, they make it come true for themselves, for their children, and for others. They give more than they receive. They labor and succeed. And often they are entrepreneurs. But their greatest contribution is more than economic, because they understand in a special way how glorious it is to be an American. They renew our pride and gratitude in the United States of America, the greatest, freest nation in the world -- the last, best hope of man on Earth.**",KamalaHarris,comment,lib,9

"For the context of this quote as well:

He claims that the democrats cheat in their elections with unregistered voters because of early voting, mail-in ballots, absentee voting, no 'voter identification' (I guess government issued identification isn't good enough), etc. So he will enact a one-day in-person voter identification required paper ballot plan. He then proceeds to tell all these Christians to go out and use all these luxuries that make voting easier, and then that they wont have to do it anymore if he is elected because they 'will be fixed'.

The absolute hypocrisy and contradictions on so many fronts. The only people who tried to cheat our elections were the republicans with their fake electors scheme that led to the Jan 6th insurrection: [https://www.lawforward.org/fake-elector-plot-started-in-wisconsin/](https://www.lawforward.org/fake-elector-plot-started-in-wisconsin/)

Both of the republicans who orchestrated the scheme plead and were found guilty. They took plea deals to testify against Trump. **They met with Trump in secret on Dec 16th. They commented on him telling protestors to come to the Capitol on the day the votes would be certified (Jan 6th), saying they have 'a unique understanding' on that call to protest. He knew about the scheme and was conspiring with the architects.** The only reason he hasn't already been put on trial in Georgia court for this is because of the Supreme Court presidential immunity ruling which Trump's lawyers argue makes him immune to prosecution because he was president at the time. See the above link for the evidence of all of this.

**Hes already -tried- to fix an election, so believe him when he says he will do it.** The fact that he is in the position to even run for president baffles me.

"Witnessed my Mom’s political wake-up call during the debateI just have to say—Kamala absolutely nailed it last night. Trump, of course, straight up lied and fumbled his way through the whole thing, and I’ll admit that Kamala dodged some direct policy questions. But she knew exactly how to handle Trump: by getting under his skin. And it worked—he was clearly rattled.

Most of the people around me, like my mom’s boyfriend, her friends, my dad, his friends, my uncles, and my grandmother, are all Trump supporters to varying degrees. Some are passionately involved, shouting at Fox News, while others, like my mom, are more passive. She’s always been more of a “I don’t like either of them” type, but then she’d echo the usual talking points: immigration, Trump’s economy, Biden’s competency, and so on. It was all just surface-level support—she never actually looked anything up for herself, just repeated what she’d heard, mostly from her boyfriend.

But last night was different. I turned on the debate, and my mom sat down to watch with me. As it unfolded, she turned to me and said, “How do people think he’s fit for this? Half the time, I don’t even know if he knows what he’s talking about.”

And then, after Kamala’s answer on abortion—where she talked about women being forced to leave their state for care and being left to suffer because doctors fear legal consequences—my mom started crying. She felt so strongly about this issue, having been a nurse for the last 30 years. Her previous support for Trump seemed to crumble right in front of me. She now admits how evil, incompetent, and dangerous this man is to our country. She sees that Kamala wants to bring us together, while Trump is focused on tearing us apart. She even admitted that Kamala has a good head on her shoulders and knows what she’s doing.

That was such a happy and proud moment for me. Being constantly surrounded by Trump supporters has been exhausting. It’s disheartening to see so many people buy into the rhetoric. But last night, Kamala changed at least one Pennsylvania voter’s mind, and that feels like a victory. I finally feel like I’m not alone in my beliefs anymore, and honestly, it’s such a relief.

My 6 year old son is just kinda along for the ride so he took the opportunity to scream for fun I think. But my 12 year old daughter legit got emotional and said “wait so this means there’s HOPE right, mommy?! I never thought I would see a whole billboard around here!”

Too many people sit at home in red states, hence why it makes it even easier for the GOP to control state, city, town and school board elections.

When we were in Israel and Palestine before the pandemic, we met with Palestinian and Israeli peace activists that were working together.  They started summer camps  and schools to bring their children together even in the West Bank. We went to a kibbutz on the Gaza strip that was sneaking water and food to the Palestinians they grew up with but were no longer allowed to work the land with. They did not want the wall. They wanted to live together.  Sadly, Hsmas killed a lot of people including out speaker on Oct 7.  Since then many Palestinian peace activists have lost their lives too. 

A rabbi in the West Bank said he went to talk to some of the Imams ( they set up the summer camps afterwards). He wanted to understand how they thought and felt about the land. What he discovered was that they felt the same as he did. His conclusion was not lets wipe out Palestinians but we need to live together. His flock worried and some were very angry but camp was going well. 

Then one day a couple of Palestinian youths killed a Jewish woman. The flock was up in arms until they saw all the Palestinian women whi came with food to sit shiva with them.

I used to be more fiscally conservative, and here's my take: the GoP has been all smoke and mirrors on fiscal responsibility for a long time: run up huge debts by fighting wars or cutting taxes for corporations and the super-rich. Because they cut tax revenue, now they want to cut govt, even when govt services are in the best interest of their constituents. And the cycle continues. Case in point: Look at Mike Johnson's resistance to FEMA funding. Where do most of those funds seem to go? Hurricane-prone red states on the Gulf of Mexico.

"Trump can claim all he wants that he doesn’t know what project 2025 is, but the republican party and the Heritage Foundation have a long history together. They work hand in hand when it comes to party platforms, policy, and political appointments. The Heritage Foundation is the think tank and information hub of the republican party. 200 of the 2025 authors even worked in the Trump administration. Trump’s VP pick, JD Vance, wrote the forward to the Project 2025 leader’s book.

The leader of the project said the plan is itself Trumpism and will be implemented on day 1 of his presidency and that they have been working with the Trump campaign very closely. They said they have thousands of people picked and ready to staff the Trump administration once he retakes power. The leader of the project also admitted in an interview that Trump is only distancing himself from the project due to the negative optics of it, not because he disagrees with the platform. 

Trump recently spoke at a heritage foundation convention thanking the foundations for their policy work and how he looks forward to advancing the “movement”. At this same convention the authors spoke about implementing the project into the next Trump administration and how they want Trump to have all of the credit. 

When Trump says he knows nothing about Project 2025, he is lying. And are we really surprised? He lied 30,000 times in 4 years when he was president. Yes, 30k. Real number.",KamalaHarris,comment,lib,8

Yeah, of course. But it's not always that easy. Some people end up trapped - by a lifetime of emotional conditioning, by children, by economic necessity, even by physical force. It's an ugly situation, but it's very real for far too many people. But if they can be informed that they still have a voice at the voting booth, that can be a first step to gaining real independence.

"When I moved from the coast to a very red state right before Obama ran in 2008 I figured I'd continue my long-standing tradition of volunteering to knock on doors of registered democrats before the election, so I did. I was hoping to do my part to help change things from being so red.

Big mistake.

I should have known after the very first door I knocked on was answered by the boyfriend of the woman whose name was on my list, and he went off, on me and on her. He was mad AF screaming. ""There aint no democrats in this house! GTFO my property right now or ....!"" but as I'd never seen such a reaction before I tried to continue on.

Turned out that first house was not an anomaly. Almost all of the names on our list were women's names, and turned out that most, if not all, of them would have preferred their partners not know their party affiliation. I got shoved off the porch at another, and concluded my door knocking after I had a shotgun pulled on me at another. I drove back to the Dem party canvasser's office I'd gotten my list from and found that pretty much everyone else ran into much the same. That was the first time they had tried organizing going to doors around here in more than a decade and they have not tried again since. We still meet, but we don't even try to make calls.

"TLDR: Most people talking about the subject don't know about the subject and act like they do. Please read I sunk 20 min into this.


The debate you're having seems to focus on something that should be a private conversation between a woman and her doctor. Medical decisions, especially regarding pregnancy, are deeply personal and require professional guidance based on individual health, not broad public opinion.

Most women have a strong understanding of when they’re ready to have a child. Research shows that women are often keenly aware of their physical, emotional, and financial readiness for motherhood. In fact, unplanned pregnancies have significantly decreased in recent decades as access to education and contraception has improved, which further suggests that women are making informed decisions about their reproductive health.

If we argue that abortion is equivalent to murder, then by that same logic, forcing women to give birth when they are not physically, mentally, or financially prepared should carry equal consequences. It would mean the government should step in to assess every woman's life—monitoring her finances, mental health, and physical condition—to decide whether she qualifies to become a mother. This level of government control over personal decisions is not only invasive but opens the door to a terrifying loss of individual rights. If we start eroding women's reproductive rights, where will it end? Will the government begin to impose religious beliefs on everyone, such as enforcing Christian doctrines?

Additionally, it’s important to clarify that under federal law, an unborn fetus is generally not considered a victim in violent crime cases. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act does allow for exceptions, but this varies by state, especially when it comes to insurance policies or familial legal standings. So while some states may count a fetus as a family member for insurance purposes, this does not universally equate to the fetus being recognized as a legal person in all contexts.

As someone who works in inpatient healthcare, I can assure you that there are strict regulations on all the procedures we perform. Everything is carefully documented and based on evidence-based research. While, unfortunately, there are always a few bad actors, they are the exception, not the rule. Most healthcare professionals are dedicated to following the latest research to ensure the best outcomes for patients. Those who don’t follow these standards often make headlines, and their licenses are typically revoked. Driving healthcare workers away from your state or county because they are afraid to go to jail if they follow the best practices is harmful for everyone. That is what is happening right now.",Republicans,comment,con,4

The issue with many Democrats is they are single issue voters. The vast majority are Pro-Union and Pro-Abortion. Very few want abortion within the final months of pregnancy, and many of them are pro- capitalism and want America to be energy independent.

Their hatred of Trump based on endless propaganda even aligns them with Dick Cheney now. I remember when Democrats rightly opposed the Iraq war I agreed with them. Trump prevented wars! Gaza genocide would not be possible without Biden/Harris & they speak about morality. I’ve seen hundreds of mangled headless or dying children. Gaza genocide was delayed by Trump. 

Trump has never been credibly accused of rape. Before he was political women threw themselves at him constantly. A man as wealthy & popular as he once was doesn’t need to resort to rape to get sexual satisfaction. Conversely Bill Clinton was credibly accused of rape/sexual assault & known to prefer underage teenage girls on Epstein Island. Democrats always look the other way when it comes to Bills sex crimes. 

The Biden Harris response to the Hurricane is a perfect example of the future of Democrats. They are seizing land with Lithium deposits, blocking private organic aid to the victims & now say that those people will probably not be able to vote in the upcoming election. Meanwhile they house millions of new voter refugee migrants all expenses paid in strategic areas while also giving the finger to American citizens.

However, I disliked Biden far more, so I did vote for Trump in 2020.

I desperately want a new choice in 2024. However, if it’s Biden vs Trump, I will vote Trump.  Biden is just a disaster and needs to go.

I say all that to say this: the attacks on Trump pose the only danger I have seen to our democracy.  It’s unbelievable that they use dubious legal reasoning to exclude candidates from the playing field.

— John Alexander Smith, 1914.
Here’s a good example of how education can help you detect a man talking rot, such as peddling a fake Roosevelt quote. Most of Roosevelt’s beliefs would be considered conservative today, but during Roosevelt’s lifetime, “conservative” was considered a dirty word in American political life. It was an insult you threw at other people, not a name you adopted for yourself. Not only did Roosevelt not call himself a conservative, but he ran for President in 1912 as leader of a party he proudly called “Progressive!”

It took a great deal of work throughout the 1950s and 1960s, led by Russell Kirk and William F. Buckley, to make the name “conservative” respectable in American politics.",Republicans,comment,con,2

"Correct. This is why Democrats constantly push negative racial narratives. It has been their bread and butter forever. They merely move around the issue in whatever way benefits them the most. The net result of their policies has always been the very negative things they claim to oppose. 

They rely on historically ignorant emotional voters. This is why they work so hard to dominate the education system. They work constantly to reshape historical narratives so that their supporters actually believe the ridiculous lies they peddle. 

When some like Clarence Thomas, Ben Carson, Candace Owens or Kanye breaks through their ceiling the attacks start. They call them uncle toms & self hating blacks etc. Some leftist just said Candace Owens has a smaller head which explains her stupid opinions. Imagine if a Republican said that about a black Democrat? Think about how many black people die in Chicago & via abortion. Their policies allow these mass deaths to continue.

"The core and pre-Trump republicans maybe but since Trump racists that wish to rollback African American rights have found a home in the Republican Party. I said maybe for pre-Trump because they might have been there but there would been a at least a token push back if they tried speaking as republicans but now you can be openly racist and republican and there is a good chance any republican that tries to say you aren’t a republican will instead get push back themselves. Now I want to say something nice about the core likely moderate republicans but my feeling is increasingly they are being pushed out of the party leaving the fringe and the unthinking masses.

The upshot is African American rights should be a settled issue but ironically due to the actions of the Republicans the main thing protecting African American rights is immigrant rights and LGBT rights (the current targets of the vocal fringe).

P.s. I do hold out some hope that the Republican Party will return to being the conservative party rather than the regressive party because the way I see it it is either that or the Republican Party will increasingly become irrelevant until a new second party rises to challenge the democrats.",Republicans,comment,con,-4

"From what I can tell, that rosy vision of America seems most reflected in the democratic party's energy. Everything I've seen from the right recently has been whinging about petty grievances, saying everyone's out to get conservatives, xenophobia towards undocumented immigrants, isolationism, authoritarianism. Blaming other groups to avoid the uncomfortable legwork of introspection.

It's honestly downright exhausting to watch, not to mention it being a betrayal of conservative Christian values like freedom, love, compassion, and personal responsibility.. I know many want to see America reinvigorated; however, siphoning more money into the coffers of billionaires and investment firms with tax cuts and stoking hatred of our fellow humans.. that path only leads to ruin for all.

I love America so much. If I believed in God I would be praying to him everyday that voters could realize how many ways they are deceived to protect the *systems* that exploit them. It feels good to hate, and it feels good to be angry at a perceived threat, but that's why we need to guard our hearts all the more against it, for those are the easiest emotions to use to hijack someone's mind.",Republicans,comment,con,-2

"The crime...paid a woman to keep their relationship private. The verdict... in the middle of an election campaign in which he is convincingly leading.

This is what native leftists, i.e. smart and beautiful, will raise as the ultimate example of a working justice system. Nothing to do with the election, of course. Against the background of 46 presidents, including people like Harding, Johnson, Truman, Nixon, Clinton, Bush, Obama… People involved in corruption, smuggling, war crimes, illegal wiretapping and what not. In the background of all this, the FIRST convicted president is for…paying a woman. The colossal crime that Guantanamo Bay and Watergate pale in comparison. And Biden and his son, involved in direct schemes for millions, are as clean as a tear. Hunter's laptop also evaporated faster than CIA-imported Nicaraguan cocaine.

Of course, all this is the result of pure coincidence and a well-functioning judicial system. 🙂 There is nothing political, this is a developed democracy, after all, and not some autocratic oligarchy in Asia, where the leading candidate is removed. Move along…

>!One thing most people don't know/remember is that Bush was heavily criticized prior to 9/11 for being more of an isolationist. It was a theme during the 2000 campaign - he was attacked for not having detailed plans to nation build and influence foreign affairs.!<

This Walz pick was probably an attempt to do no harm (apparently they backed off of Kelly, who would have made Arizona less of a hurdle, because of something they picked up while vetting him).

She may have been a hardnosed prosecutor, but her most relevant record from senate votes/2020 presidential campaign is very liberal. This was an opportunity to reach out to those in the center that she has now passed on (it seems Walz is farther on the left than she is).

She can still win, but Democrats have made it harder for themselves than it had to be. Trump's paths, either GA+PA or GA+AZ+WI, are still clear as day.",Conservative,comment,con,17

US talk show host Tucker Carlson slammed as 'traitor' after being pictured in Russia ahead of 'sit-down interview with Putin',Conservative,post,con,3183

He is not our friend.",Conservative,comment,con,139
"I don't understand why more folks don't understand that the Russian government is a criminal organization. ""Oligarchy,"" in this case, is a fancy for ""mafia"". The invasion in 2014 and then in 2022 was Putin's attempts to capture and control commodities markets, such as natural gas, wheat, sunflower oil, uranium, and others. By subjugation Ukraine, the Oligarchs could control and thus corrupt these huge commodities markets, lining their and further strengthening Russian aggression in Europe. Stop Russian corruption now, or we will be forced to stop them later.

The US knows how to disable the mafia. Let's do that with Russia.

And btw, you can be against the way we are funding Ukraine and still see Russia as a threat that must be stopped. You don't have to choose one side or the other, but you do need to make smart choices.",Conservative,comment,con,493

Sidney Powell Pleads Guilty In Georgia Election Case,Conservative,post,con,3176
"For context:

""Powell, who was charged alongside Trump and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering law, entered the plea just a day before jury selection was set to start in her trial. She pleaded guilty to **six misdemeanors** related to intentionally interfering with the performance of election duties.  
  
As part of the deal, **she will serve six years of probation, will be fined $6,000 and will have to write an apology letter to Georgia and its residents**. She also agreed to testify truthfully against her co-defendants at future trials.""

A ""nothing"" consequence.",Conservative,comment,con,440
"She kracked! Pleaded guilty to all charges and is cooperating with the prosecutors in the racketeering case against Trump and his allies involved in the case.

Trump should have never associated with a crackpot like this woman. She and Lin Wood helped to discourage GOP voter turnout in Georgia and cost those two senate seats. 

She was a clown then and now is going to bite Trump in the butt in the coming months by testifying against him. Bad day today for him.",Conservative,comment,con,283
"> Fulton County prosecutors are recommending a sentence of six years probation. Powell will also be required to testify at future trials and write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia.

> As part of her guilty plea, Powell is admitting her role in the January 2021 breach of election systems in rural Coffee County, Georgia. With the help of local GOP officials, a group of Trump supporters accessed and copied information from the county’s election systems in hopes of somehow proving that the election was rigged against Trump.

Just to add context - Sidney Powell and Cheeseboro requested speedy trials with jury selection slated to start today.  So as it stands the DA will have to do two trials - one for Powell and Cheeseboro and another for whoever is left.  That is obviously not ideal for them so I'm sure that is why they cut this deal and if I had to guess I bet they are off having talks with Cheeseboro to find a deal he'll accept so this first trial goes away.,Conservative,comment,con,39

"6 years probation is a lot better than potential 20 years in the fed for RICO charges.

But he’s lost me since 2020 and done nothing to earn my vote. It’s been absurd to see this sub so often be frothing at the mouth in support of trump, with anyone who has the gall to oppose him if a rino even if they’re to the right of him! Desantis was loved here till the moment he dared to run against trump. Ridiculous. And the thing is that trump is gonna flounder against biden because he’s burned too many bridges and despite how things are rn too many will simply say “not trump” and vote for Biden again. Trump is loved by his base but loathed by moderates and independents. And, if he somehow limps across 270 this November he won’t get Anything done, Afterall he’s saying the same shit he said leading up to 2016. He’ll be stonewalled in  congress regardless of who holds the congress, and won’t be allowed to run in 2028 which means we’ll have to run without an incumbency bias in our favor.

"Had RFK Jr. been allowed to run in the DNC primary, he would have put up a strong fight against Biden and very well could have won the primary.

However, the DNC did not give RFK Jr. that chance. The party that claims they are fighting for democracy kicked him off the ballot and colluded with the media to engage in a smear campaign against him. 

The Democratic Party did not give RFK Jr. or his supporters a voice. They silenced them, censored them, threatened them, smeared them, and used dirty political tactics to keep him off the ballot to stop him and his supporters. 

The Trump campaign was the only one willing to cross ideological and party lines to talk with RFK’s campaign and his supporters. The Democrats and Kamala Harris were not.

The Democrats may act like RFK’s endorsement means nothing. But given RFK was polling around 5%, those votes are enough to give either Trump or Harris the election. RFK’s endorsement tilts the election in Trumps favor. It is a huge and crucial endorsement for Trump, even CNN has admitted this:

"Whether or not you believe in the vote stealing there are several issues that we KNOW happened that could lead anyone to say it was rigged if it happened to their candidate.  1. States changing voting laws without following their constitution. 2. Google admitting on tape that they were going to skew results of searches to be anti Trump, 3.

"The left mocking him for this is really something. 

While Biden avoids the press to a historic degree, doesn’t speak to the American people, doesn’t hold events or campaign.

Trump had the guts to go into what is essentially enemy territory to try to win votes. He campaigned in the Bronx to try to win votes. 

He’s there. He’s working hard. He’s trying to sell his vision to anyone he can. Not playing it safe.

"She actually accomplished a lot before she quit.

&#x200B;

* She drained a ton of money from the RNC coffers.  The democrat money behind her is a given but that's near inexhaustible.  The Republican money she wasted wont be able to be used for Trump.

&#x200B;

* By staying in this long, she produced a lot of data showing which states and specifically which counties Trump is the weakest.  Yes, tons of Democrats voted for her in places like DC and Vermont but knowing where all the patches of weak support for Trump in swing states is invaluable for the Democrats.  A non-contested primary wouldn't have provided that.

&#x200B;

She was a very effective instrument for the Democrats.  They sure spent a ton of money keeping her in the race but the analytics they got from a full primary is very valuable information. If Biden wins the general, she will probably get a cabinet position as a show of ""unity.""",Conservative,comment,con,38

TW: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.

"I can't tell if we're being brigaded or conservatives really think Biden shouldn't debate Trump because Trump wouldn't debate other nominees. 

I do think there's a world of difference between Trump debating other nominees and our two presidential candidates debating each other. Sure Biden will likely sort-of-effectively use the fact that Trump didn't debate in the primaries, but the reality is that that argument won't actually sway anyone's mind. 

Biden wasn't going to debate anyway, and no one is going to change their mind based on him giving any particular reasoning. At this point, he could literally say that old age has brought back on his speech impediment and that his mental faculties aren't what they used to be so he can't debate, and I doubt it's seriously changing most folks minds.

He does know though that getting an absolute beat down and everyone seeing the emperor without any clothes on will start to sway minds.",Conservative,comment,con,154

"If it isn't clear - these protests are designed to demonstrate that the left has the right to protest and free speech, the right does not.

You look at any right wing protest and it is marred with governments declaring states of emergencies or journalists creating a narrative of violence and racism. 

Charlottesville Unite the Right rally - the violence was caused by left-wing counter-protesters from UVA. And the single death of an counter-protester white girl who had a heart attack after being hit by a car. Somehow killing a white protestor is a federal hate crime and he narrowly avoided the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 419 years and $25 million in damages.

And the Covington catholic high school March for Life was framed as a racist protest because a teenager smiled while being harassed by a left-wing counter protestor. Mainstream media set out to destroy that high school student's life.

And you have Kyle Rittenhouse, they are still trying to ruin his life for protecting his life by shooting violent left-wing rioters.

You had [220 separate violent riots](https://i.imgur.com/rEAMIgF.png) from the left just for George Floyd and not a single protestor was demonized or even admonished by journalists.

Every President before him has *had* Presidential Immunity, it just wasn't official.  All he's asking for is for it to be made official, so that political outsiders like him can use it too.

This will be the last election ever, he will do a holocaust on LGBT and minorities, he will open concentration camps and restart slavery. None of which is based on anything real. He went from ""great policy, but he's embarrassing and mean"" to ""this guy is Hitler 2.0, and his supporters are all nazis"".

"As a guy in Ohio, it's wild how we got here and it's because both sides got greedy with what they wanted, with this last vote being the latest round. 

First, roe is overturned and the govenor does 6 week abortion ban with no exceptions. There's extreme pushback and it goes to courts and is paused. We have the 10 year old girl who gets pregnant and has to go to indiana for an abortion. If he does 12 week with exceptions is there the same outcry? 

Then they try to change the amendment procedure. Raising the threshold to 60% AND requiring signatures from 5% of EVERY county to get on the ballot. Greedy. Many people voted against this because of the added stipulation of it requiring every county to get on the ballot. If it's just the 60% change, it probably passes. Also, it was a special election that they held a year after specifically banning all special elections because they're a waste of money, and it was, cost us $18 million and counting.

Now in reaction to this we have what just passed, which is a pretty locktight anyone can get an abortion at anytime as long as a doctor okays it. It's a pretty greedy response to what the GOP was trying to do but imo was able to pass with the language it has because of how the legislature acted after RvW was overturned.

"Ohio resident here:

* There was a lot more money put into the Yes (in favor of abortion) than the No, but there was constant messaging from No.  I would say that TV spots were about 3 to 1 Yes.
* This is a red state that went for Trump by 6-7 points in 2020
* There were only two statewide issues, this and marijuana legalization.  They both passed by almost identical margins, and I think it is safe to say most of those were either dual Yes or dual No, and the net was probably to help both get passed.
* The ballot language is pretty bad.  It just gives ""individuals"" the right to abortion and says nothing about age.  It allows the state to still ban abortion after ""viability"" to be judged on a case by case basis, but with a blanket exemption for medical necessity.
* I think this does show that in all but the most conservative states, strict abortion restrictions are going to be a political loser.  The pro-abortion side simply has (a lot) more money and highly motivated voters, and it will bring out younger people who might not vote otherwise.  And even most people who are generally against abortion like to have some wiggle room (rape and medical necessity at the very least).
* The pro-abortion side is pretty good at hiding what they really want (everything just short of actual infanticide) and keeping things in the rape-and-necessity realm when they are looking for votes.  Pro-life forces tend to be more absolutist in their messaging to voters (no abortions, ever), which is much more honest but doesn't go over well with the middle of the road voters.",Conservative,comment,con,-10

Very interested to see some responses.  

Here’s one of mine speaking anecdotally from my employer:

Our supply chain suffered greatly during COVID due to a JIT (just in time) inventory system, which is fairly common among manufacturers.  This disruption caused us to change our philosophy and we shifted to massively front loading our raw materials to ensure our production lines would not be disrupted.  Because of this, our suppliers started seeing massive amounts of business from other companies who made a similar shift.  These suppliers, who now had more business than they could handle, did what any smart business would do in that situation and started massively raising prices.  This went on for 18 months with large increases roughly every 6 months into late 2021.",Conservative,comment,con,97

"In the last decade of his life my dad went **deep** into geneology. Found out that my great-great-great-grandfather had served in the Confederate Army, (26th Virginia Infantry Company F, 1861-1863). Digging further, we found that he didn't own a single slave and his meager farm in Gloucester County, VA was run entirely by himself, his wife, and their six children. We had to go back two further generations to find anyone in the family tree that actually owned slaves. *(Aside: My mother's entire side of the family hadn't immigrated here yet, and wouldn't be here until 1898-1901.)*

What we *also* found were correspondence to his family and old recruiting 'posters' of the day. People like to apply modern day communication methods to historical events but they didn't have daily newspapers or the internet feeding them a constant 24 hour news cycle. No readily available Congressional Record for the average farmer to read to know what was going on in DC. Reading the few letters my dad had been able to dig up, my third-great-grandfather was firmly under the belief that the U.S. Government had turned on its citizens in the south because that's what his peers led him to understand. He had no reason to question otherwise. Not once in any of his letters did he mention slavery. He believed he was fighting to ensure the freedom of his children from a federal government abusing their power.",Conservative,comment,con,15

**Tolerate**, as in: ""we know it's bad, but we love the empire we are building out of it. Just let those radical Quakers and Republicans over there complain about it. Hopefully they'll do something.""

I feel it's also important to note that almost as soon as the United States became a thing, states all over the country began to outlaw slavery, and Jefferson--even as a slave owner--officially ended the slave trade when he became President (even if it would take another 50 years for emancipation).",Conservative,comment,con,95

"I’ve leaned Republican most of my life except maybe the 90s. Ronald Reagan is my all-time favorite and I’m planning to watch Reagan starring Dennis Quaid. Dude has range. Dennis also portrayed Bill Clinton a decade ago.

I voted for Trump in 2020 and will vote for him again in November. My family are Republicans and we live in Orange County which is Trump territory. But this year, I’m going to stay quiet. Don’t be boastful. Just vote and wait for the results. Be the silent voters like back in 2016. Let the Democrats make all the useless noise.

I follow Catturd2 on X who is a diehard Trumper and there’s a chart that shows 68% who are unmarried women are Democrats. So Heels Up Harris basically only has the Karen / femcel voters. The lonely women who treat stray cats as their children and they happen to be their only company.

We cannot have Knee Pad Kamala as President. It’s asking Kathleen Kennedy to be our President of the United States. During her campaign, no debates or interviews. Talks about Trump a thousand times. Doesn’t talk about what she can do for us. She can’t. Because she hasn’t even shown us anything as the VP.

Democrats are effin liars next to their mainstream media lying and brainwashing us thinking they’re on the right side of history. F them. Don’t listen to these stupid celebrities or the media. They are our enemies. Thank you, RFK Jr., for dropping the truth bomb on these Demmies turned Commies.

Kamala as POTUS is going to make us worse for the next 4 years when it’s already been shit for the last 3.5. She’s done absolutely nothing as VP and the only reason she got candidacy is because Biden decayed quickly.

Glad to see Trump back as the betting favorite on Bovada. We will win in Nov. But stay quiet 🤫 and grounded. Let the media and Demonrats keep jabbering about nonsense. It didn’t work in 2016, it won’t work in 2024.

"I’ve leaned Republican most of my life except maybe the 90s. Ronald Reagan is my all-time favorite and I’m planning to watch Reagan starring Dennis Quaid. Dude has range. Dennis also portrayed Bill Clinton a decade ago.

I voted for Trump in 2020 and will vote for him again in November. My family are Republicans and we live in Orange County which is Trump territory. But this year, I’m going to stay quiet. Don’t be boastful. Just vote and wait for the results. Be the silent voters like back in 2016. Let the Democrats make all the useless noise.

I follow Catturd2 on X who is a diehard Trumper and there’s a chart that shows 68% who are unmarried women are Democrats. So Heels Up Harris basically only has the Karen / femcel voters. The lonely women who treat stray cats as their children and they happen to be their only company.

We cannot have Knee Pad Kamala as President. It’s asking Kathleen Kennedy to be our President of the United States. During her campaign, no debates or interviews. Talks about Trump a thousand times. Doesn’t talk about what she can do for us. She can’t. Because she hasn’t even shown us anything as the VP.

Democrats are effin liars next to their mainstream media lying and brainwashing us thinking they’re on the right side of history. F them. Don’t listen to these stupid celebrities or the media. They are our enemies. Thank you, RFK Jr., for dropping the truth bomb on these Demmies turned Commies.

Kamala as POTUS is going to make us worse for the next 4 years when it’s already been shit for the last 3.5. She’s done absolutely nothing as VP and the only reason she got candidacy is because Biden decayed quickly.

Glad to see Trump back as the betting favorite on Bovada. We will win in Nov. But stay quiet 🤫 and grounded. Let the media and Demonrats keep jabbering about nonsense. It didn’t work in 2016, it won’t work in 2024.

They have a choice people of my generation did not, whether to change sex and this conversation seems to be happening WAY TO EARLY.  In the UK, if you fly a St George flag, the National flag, apparently your a racist but its 'a ok' to talk sex change with a twelve year old.  For those reasons, if i we're an American citizen, there is only one common sense vote.  Trump.  Whatever your feelings on the man on a personal level, he's the only pick who is running on ending the Ukraine war and tightening the boarder with Mexico/deporting illegal migrants.  Apparently Harris has been making the big decisions while Joe was on vacation or having an early day so her record stinks as bad as Joe's ever did, she's a radical left loony tune and as a member of the free World i implore you from Britain to vote no war and vote Trump because where you lead the UK seems to follow and i don't like the idea of a third World war we seem to be on the brink of.

"I don't think I've ever seen an election like this. I thought 2016 was rough with Trump v. Hillary. I didn't pay attention as much back then to what was going on outside the Trump campaign. I was on The Donald (I think that was it was called) and the hype back then was absolutely crazy. I loved the energy. I really liked what Trump was saying and I voted for him and I never really expected him to win based on the polls at the time. I think Hillary campaigned well ( I don't know for certain because I didn't follow her campaign very closely). I followed Trumps and watched every rally every interview and I was thrilled to vote for a man who clearly cared about his country. Trump didn't have to run for president. He told Ophra a long time ago that he would consider running if things ever got bad enough. 

This election is the worst election I have ever seen because for the first time in a long time I'm watching both sides closely. I haven't done this since Obama was running for President the first time. 

Kamala Harris has no clue what she is doing in her campaign. She was a terrible VP with a low approval rating, the media is praising her for doing nothing and copying Trumps and Vance's ideas and I'm not sure how she is getting away with it. 

If Trump cleared out a diner, replaced it with people who asked nice questions and only acted like they supported him, it would be blasted all over the national news. It would disgrace him. Yet Harris can do this and we get a few stories and the left even ignores it and acts like it's fine. 

I don't understand what is going on. I know Harris is not going to be President. You can't run on nothing but ""skin color/race"" ""being a woman"" and being a liberal from California. That just doesn't work. I hope American's are smart enough to keep her out of office.",Trump,comment,con,15

It's been said before and ill just reiterate, when a group or party or faction, continually pushes this same point over and over and over for years, people begin to believe it's the truth, especially if it's coming from someone who has a strong foothold or is well respected in the mindset of many.

"I flicked off Kamala Harris today.😅I don’t know whether to continue to laugh for the rest of my life considering almost no one will ever get to say “yeah. I flicked off the first ever female presidential candidate in the US…but she’s honestly kinda evil so whatever” and feel justified because of the destruction she causes, or feel like shit because that action stoops just as low as the democrats. 

I don’t know whether to feel embarrassed or very accomplished. It’s something that so many people want to do, but in the moment wouldn’t. I almost put my hand down. In a small moment of anger towards her and her policies I impulsively just kept my middle finger up…

I live near LAX and she was headed to the airport to board Airforce 2. As we reached the very end of Pershing drive going southbound and were stopped at the very end light, Kamala’s entire motorcade turned the corner and began a to drive past us northbound. Our lane, far left lane, was the closest one to them. Her car drove right past us. The windows were not really super tinted. We saw her, and as she turned the corner she could see everyone in their cars. Everyone could see each other. It’s not hard to. We could all see her in the backseat.m

For about 2-3 brief seconds, as her car got closer and approached its parallel point to us, she looked at me, and then put her head down. To keep the quality of the footage my middle finger is not in the video, but it was there behind the camera. The camera doesn’t do justice to what my husband and I actually saw in that car. 

Either way 2 hours later we just went home and I jammed to music so casually as if I did not just hand signal fuck you to the vice president of the United States and the first ever female VP. Lawwwdddd. 

Freedom of Speech though…🤷🏻‍♀️

"Word Salad Lyrics (by Lord Pathopax)

[Chorus: In the style of The Wiggles]
Word salad, dummy, dummy
Word salad, dummy, dummy
Word salad, dummy, dummy
Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy
Word salad!

[Verse 1]
Let's make some word salad today
It's fun to do it's the far left way
Take all the words that you can't explain
It's going to be a word structure strain

Verse 2]
The first step: Gaslight in batches
The second step: Hike your taxes
The third step: Ignore all questions 
Call MAGA felons and create more inflation 

[Verse 3]
Now we've groomed the youth, it's time we organize and pimp
Have mainstream media endorse all our scripts
Ignore our crimes and bus in some goons
We all will hopefully destroy America soon

[Verse 4]
The first step: Attach a word with a common phrase
The second step: repeat said phrase but in reverse praise.
The third step: Throw in some cackles,
drown your puppet masters voice as was rehearsed.

[Verse 5]
Now we've had our word salad today
It's time for celebs to earn their pay
Obama and Soros will take care of the rest
Who cares if... the entire world's a mess

What are the reasons for not doing it other than cheating,Trump,comment,con,62
It’s incredible this even has to be talked about.  ID for voting should be the norm in the US as it is everywhere else.,Trump,comment,con,66
It’s only common sense. You need ID for everything else you do. There’s no reason not to have it for something so important to all of us unless you’re up to no good.,Trump,comment,con,33
Every other country does it,Trump,comment,con,9
Absolutely! I have to show ID to do ANYTHING else including menial tasks like buying cough syrup or cooking sherry. Blows my mind to know it’s not required during the process to pick our country’s leadership.,Trump,comment,con,8

Their dating pool is nearly nonexistent, and even moreso after they chop their nuts off.  I really feel like Democrats are trying to manufacture a perpetually angry voting cohort, pushing people down this route and then watching it blow up.  I don't have a problem with gays, but I have a problem with Communists and America-haters, and I don't think public policy should be determined by the mentally ill.",Trump,comment,con,8
"One of the only reasons why these people act so violently towards others, is the fact that they know defending yourself via 2nd amendment is non existent in a democratic cesspool.

"What gets me about this is you will notice it's always the liberals that are acting violently but they are afraid of anyone who is MAGA.   Last week I was permantly banned from the dementia site (I am a caregiver to a mom with dementia) because I said Trump was best for our country.   They got mad because I was being political yet I was just responding to a political pro liberal post someone posted.  It's just a natural instinct when someone starts bashing republicans that I say my part. It had been a really helpful site for me but unfornately although they didn't say his name, the constant bashing and blaming the conservatives for the plight of the elderly was obviously political.   It seems the there are zero general topic sites (neighborhood sites, caregiving, etc that aren't making snide remarks about conservatives in one way or the other and are quick to ""ban"" anyone who has a conservative opinion or suggests someone take responsiblity for their own lives instead of depend on the government to rescue their every need.",Trump,comment,con,2

"Kamala Harris made headlines last week when she joked in a radio interview that of course she smoked marijuana in her younger years: “Half my family’s from Jamaica. Are you kidding me?”

But the crack didn’t go over well with at least one Jamaican: Donald J. Harris, her father.The elder Harris sent an unsolicited statement to Kingston-based Jamaica Global Online, for which the emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University wrote a recent essay on his family’s history.

“My dear departed grandmothers (whose extraordinary legacy I described in a recent essay on this website), as well as my deceased parents, must be turning in their grave right now to see their family’s name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity being connected, in any way, jokingly or not with the fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker and in the pursuit of identity politics,” he wrote.

“Speaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty,” he added.
